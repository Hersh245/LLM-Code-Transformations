// Explanation of transformations:
// 1. Loop permutation: The outer loop has been changed to iterate over `j` instead of `i`. This change can help improve data locality and cache efficiency by accessing elements of arrays `C`, `A`, and `B` in a more contiguous manner.
// 2. Loop tiling: Tiling has been applied to both loops to break down the computation into smaller chunks that can fit into cache memory. This can help reduce memory access latency and improve data reuse.
// 3. Loop distribution: The loops have been distributed in a way that the innermost loop is now the loop over `k`. This can help expose more parallelism and potentially improve performance by allowing more operations to be executed concurrently.
// 4. Loop fusion: Since the loops are now distributed differently, loop fusion is implicitly applied by combining the operations into a single loop nest. This can help reduce loop overhead and improve overall efficiency.
