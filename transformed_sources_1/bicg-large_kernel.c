// 1. Loop Permutation: The inner and outer loops have been swapped to improve data locality. This can help in better utilizing the cache and reducing memory access latency.
// 
// 2. Loop Distribution: The loop over variable `j` has been moved to the outermost level to enable loop tiling. This can help in exploiting parallelism and improving memory access patterns.
// 
// 3. Loop Fusion: The loops over variables `i` and `j` have been fused into a single loop to reduce loop overhead and improve performance. This can also help in better utilizing hardware resources.
