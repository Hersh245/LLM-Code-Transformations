// To optimize the provided C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latencies, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gemver(int n,double alpha,double beta,double A[120][120],double u1[120],double v1[120],double u2[120],double v2[120],double w[120],double x[120],double y[120],double z[120])
{
  int i, j, ii, jj;
  const int BLOCK_SIZE = 30; // Example block size for tiling, can be tuned for specific hardware
  
#pragma scop
  
  // Loop tiling for the first loop nest
  // This improves data locality and cache utilization
  for (ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += BLOCK_SIZE) {
    for (jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += BLOCK_SIZE) {
      
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
      
      for (i = ii; i < ii + BLOCK_SIZE && i < 120; i++) {
        
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
        for (j = jj; j < jj + BLOCK_SIZE && j < 120; j++) {
          A[i][j] += u1[i] * v1[j] + u2[i] * v2[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Loop distribution applied to the second and third loop nests
  // This allows for more efficient pipelining and parallel execution
  
  // First part of the distributed loop
  for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
    x[i] = 0; // Initialize x[i] to ensure correct accumulation
  }
  
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  
  for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
    
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
    for (j = 0; j < 120; j++) {
      x[i] += beta * A[j][i] * y[j];
    }
  }
  
  // Second part of the distributed loop
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
  for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
    x[i] += z[i];
  }
  
  // Loop tiling for the last loop nest
  for (ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += BLOCK_SIZE) {
    
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    
    for (i = ii; i < ii + BLOCK_SIZE && i < 120; i++) {
      w[i] = 0; // Initialize w[i] to ensure correct accumulation
      
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 0; j < 120; j++) {
        w[i] += alpha * A[i][j] * x[j];
      }
    }
  }
  
#pragma endscop
}
// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the first and last loop nests to improve data locality and cache utilization. By processing the data in smaller blocks, we ensure that the working set fits into the cache, reducing memory access times. The block size (`BLOCK_SIZE`) is a tunable parameter that should be optimized based on the specific hardware's cache size and architecture.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The second and third loop nests are distributed to separate the accumulation in `x[i]` from the addition of `z[i]`. This allows for more efficient pipelining and parallel execution of independent operations. Initializing `x[i]` before the loop ensures that we start with a clean slate for accumulation.
// 
// 3. **Pragma Directives**: The `#pragma ACCEL` directives are strategically placed to hint at the compiler for automatic pipeline generation, parallel execution, and other optimizations. The `FACTOR=auto` parameter allows the HLS tool to automatically determine the optimal factor for parallelism and pipelining.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is better structured for parallel execution and efficient memory access patterns, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA-based accelerators.
