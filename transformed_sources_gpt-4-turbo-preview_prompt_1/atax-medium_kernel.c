// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latency. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(double A[390][410], double x[410], double y[410], double tmp[390]) {
  int i, j;
  
  // Initialize y to 0
  for (i = 0; i < 410; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
  }
  
  // Loop tiling is applied here to improve data locality and cache utilization
  int TILE_SIZE = 32; // Example tile size, can be adjusted based on the target architecture
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 390; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    int tile_end_i = ii + TILE_SIZE < 390 ? ii + TILE_SIZE : 390;
    
    // Initialize tmp within the tile to reduce scope and improve data locality
    for (i = ii; i < tile_end_i; i++) {
      tmp[i] = 0.0;
    }
    
    // Loop distribution is applied to separate the two inner loops
    // This allows for independent optimization and parallelization of each loop
    
    // First distributed loop - Compute tmp
    for (i = ii; i < tile_end_i; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
      for (j = 0; j < 410; j++) {
        tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
      }
    }
    
    // Second distributed loop - Update y
    for (i = ii; i < tile_end_i; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
      for (j = 0; j < 410; j++) {
        y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling on the Outer Loop**: This transformation breaks the outer loop into smaller chunks or "tiles". This improves data locality by working on a smaller subset of the data at a time, which can be more effectively cached. It also offers potential for parallel execution of independent tiles.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The original code had nested loops performing two distinct operations within the innermost loop. By distributing the loops, we separate these operations. This allows for independent optimization of each loop, such as parallelization and reduction optimizations, without interference between the different operations.
// 
// 3. **Parallelization Directives**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directives with automatic factor determination (`FACTOR=auto`) are kept to hint at parallel execution where possible. This is particularly effective after loop distribution, as each operation within the distributed loops can be optimized independently for parallel execution.
// 
// 4. **Reduction Initialization Scope Reduction**: The initialization of the `tmp` array is moved inside the tiled loop. This change reduces the scope of the `tmp` array initialization, ensuring that it's reset for each tile and potentially reducing the overhead of initializing a large array in one go.
// 
// ### Note:
// - The `TILE_SIZE` is chosen as an example. The optimal tile size depends on the specific architecture and should be determined based on the target device's cache size and memory bandwidth.
// - The transformations aim to improve the performance by enhancing data locality, reducing memory access latency, and increasing the opportunity for parallel execution. However, the actual performance gain can vary depending on the specific hardware and compiler optimizations.
