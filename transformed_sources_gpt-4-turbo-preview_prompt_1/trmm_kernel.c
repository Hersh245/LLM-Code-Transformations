// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_trmm(double alpha, double A[60][60], double B[60][80]) {
  // Transformed code for HLS optimization
  
  // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // Loop permutation is applied to interchange loops for better memory access patterns and parallelism.
  // Loop fusion could be considered but may not be directly applicable due to the nature of operations.
  
  const int TILE_SIZE_I = 10; // Tile size for the i dimension, chosen based on target architecture constraints
  const int TILE_SIZE_K = 10; // Tile size for the k dimension
  
  double tempB[60][80]; // Temporary storage for B to improve data locality
  
  // Copy B to tempB to ensure all updates are done in a localized manner
  for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      tempB[i][j] = B[i][j];
    }
  }
  
  // Loop tiling for i and k loops
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 60; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
    for (int kk = 0; kk < 60; kk += TILE_SIZE_K) {
      
      // Loop permutation to bring the j loop to the outermost position for better memory access pattern
      for (int j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
        
        // Inner tiled loops
        for (int i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_I && i < 60; i++) {
          
          // Apply loop tiling and loop permutation optimizations
          for (int k = kk; k < kk + TILE_SIZE_K && k < 60; k++) {
            if (k > i) {
              tempB[i][j] += A[k][i] * B[k][j];
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Scale by alpha and write back to B
  for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      B[i][j] = alpha * tempB[i][j];
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is applied to the `i` and `k` loops to improve data locality and cache usage. By processing the data in smaller blocks, we ensure that the working set fits into the faster, on-chip memory, reducing memory access times and improving overall performance.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: The `j` loop is moved to the outermost position, which improves the memory access pattern for the `B` and `tempB` arrays. This transformation is beneficial for accessing contiguous memory locations, which is more efficient on many architectures due to spatial locality.
// 
// 3. **Temporary Array for `B`**: A temporary array `tempB` is used to store intermediate results. This approach improves data locality and ensures that the updates to `B` are done in a more efficient manner. After all computations are done, the results are written back to the original `B` array.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: While not directly applied in this transformation due to the nature of the operations (the need for a complete `tempB` before scaling by `alpha`), it's generally a useful optimization for combining multiple loops over the same range into a single loop to reduce loop overhead and improve data locality.
// 
// These transformations aim to optimize the code for HLS by improving parallelism, reducing memory access times, and ensuring efficient use of available resources. The specific tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I` and `TILE_SIZE_K`) should be chosen based on the target architecture's constraints and the available on-chip memory.
