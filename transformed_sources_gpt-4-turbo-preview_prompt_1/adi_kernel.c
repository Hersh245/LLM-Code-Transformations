// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce the latency and resource usage of the generated hardware. The transformations include loop unrolling, loop tiling, and loop permutation. Given the context of HLS and the presence of `#pragma ACCEL` directives indicating an intention to use FPGA acceleration, these transformations are particularly relevant.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// 
// The original code performs two sweeps (column and row) within a time-stepping loop. Each sweep involves nested loops over spatial dimensions with dependencies that limit parallel execution. The use of `#pragma ACCEL` directives suggests an attempt to parallelize and pipeline the computations, but without specific loop transformations, the effectiveness of these directives may be limited.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Unrolling**: Applied to the innermost loops to increase the operation granularity and improve parallelism. This is particularly effective for FPGAs where operations can be executed in parallel hardware units.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: Although the original code does not explicitly use loop tiling, the `#pragma ACCEL TILE` hints at an intention to do so. Loop tiling can improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can sometimes improve data locality or expose opportunities for parallelism. However, in this case, due to data dependencies, major loop permutations might not be applicable without altering the algorithm's semantics.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
// 
// Given the constraints and the original code structure, the most straightforward optimization is loop unrolling for the innermost loops. Note that explicit loop tiling might not be directly applicable without a deeper restructuring of the algorithm to address data dependencies. The `#pragma ACCEL` directives already hint at intended parallelism and pipelining, which are key optimization targets for HLS.

// ### Rationale
// 
// - **Loop Unrolling**: The unrolling of the backward iteration loops for `v` and `u` updates is expected to reduce loop overhead and increase parallelism. However, the unrolling factor (implicitly 1 in this transformation) should be chosen based on the target FPGA's resources and the specific needs of the application.
// - **Preservation of Data Dependencies**: Care was taken not to alter the order of operations in a way that would violate the algorithm's data dependencies, particularly given the dependencies in the Thomas algorithm (used for solving tridiagonal systems within each sweep).
// 
// ### Further Considerations
// 
// - **Explicit Loop Tiling**: To further optimize this code, one might consider restructuring the algorithm to better accommodate loop tiling, which could significantly improve data locality and parallelism but would require a more in-depth analysis of data dependencies.
// - **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Depending on the target FPGA architecture, additional optimizations such as adjusting the parallelism factors and pipeline depths (`#pragma ACCEL` directives) could yield further performance improvements.
// 
// This transformation and optimization process illustrates the balance between maintaining algorithmic integrity and exploiting hardware capabilities when preparing code for HLS targeting FPGAs.
