// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply a combination of code transformations such as loop tiling, loop permutation, and loop parallelization. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// The original code performs a 2D Jacobi iteration over matrices `A` and `B`. It contains nested loops with dependencies that limit parallel execution. The use of `#pragma ACCEL` directives suggests an intention to exploit hardware acceleration features like pipelining, tiling, and parallel execution. However, without specific transformations, the compiler might not fully utilize the hardware capabilities.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
// Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_jacobi_2d_optimized(int tsteps, int n, double A[90][90], double B[90][90]) {
  int t, i, j, ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 16; // Example tile size, can be tuned for specific hardware

  for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
    // Loop tiling for B matrix computation
    for (i = 1; i < 89; i += TILE_SIZE) {
      for (j = 1; j < 89; j += TILE_SIZE) {
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
        for (ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii < 89; ii++) {
          for (jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE && jj < 89; jj++) {
            B[ii][jj] = 0.2 * (A[ii][jj] + A[ii][jj - 1] + A[ii][1 + jj] + A[1 + ii][jj] + A[ii - 1][jj]);
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // Loop tiling for A matrix computation
    for (i = 1; i < 89; i += TILE_SIZE) {
      for (j = 1; j < 89; j += TILE_SIZE) {
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
        for (ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii < 89; ii++) {
          for (jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE && jj < 89; jj++) {
            A[ii][jj] = 0.2 * (B[ii][jj] + B[ii][jj - 1] + B[ii][1 + jj] + B[1 + ii][jj] + B[ii - 1][jj]);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Explanation of Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation breaks down the loops into smaller chunks or "tiles". It improves data locality by working on a smaller subset of the data that fits into the cache, reducing memory access times. In the transformed code, both the update loops for matrices `A` and `B` are tiled with a `TILE_SIZE` that can be adjusted based on the target hardware's cache size.
// 
// 2. **Pipelining**: By applying the `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directive inside the tiled loops, we encourage the compiler to pipeline these operations, allowing for multiple iterations of the loop to be executed in parallel. This is particularly effective after tiling, as each tile can be processed independently in a pipeline stage, improving throughput.
// 
// 3. **Parallel Execution**: Although explicit parallelization directives (`#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL`) were not added in the transformed code, the tiling and pipelining transformations inherently increase the opportunity for parallel execution. The compiler can automatically infer parallelism within the tiled loops, especially when targeting FPGA or other hardware accelerators.
// 
// ### Conclusion
// The transformed code aims to leverage loop tiling and pipelining to improve the performance of the 2D Jacobi iteration on hardware accelerators. By working on smaller data chunks and enabling more efficient use of the pipeline and parallel execution capabilities of the hardware, significant performance gains can be achieved. The specific tile size and other parameters may need to be tuned based on the target hardware's characteristics for optimal performance.
