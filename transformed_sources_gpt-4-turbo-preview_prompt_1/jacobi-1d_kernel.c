// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_jacobi_1d_optimized(int tsteps, int n, double A[120], double B[120])
{
    int t, i, ii;
    const int TILE_SIZE = 30; // Example tile size, can be adjusted based on the target architecture and memory bandwidth

    // Loop tiling applied to the inner loop to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory
    for (t = 0; t < 40; t++)
    {
        // Loop distribution applied to separate the dependencies between A and B updates
        for (ii = 1; ii < 120 - 1; ii += TILE_SIZE)
        {
            int upper_bound = ii + TILE_SIZE < 119 ? ii + TILE_SIZE : 119;
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR = auto{ __PARA__L1 }
            for (i = ii; i < upper_bound; i++)
            {
                B[i] = 0.33333 * (A[i - 1] + A[i] + A[i + 1]);
            }
        }
        for (ii = 1; ii < 120 - 1; ii += TILE_SIZE)
        {
            int upper_bound = ii + TILE_SIZE < 119 ? ii + TILE_SIZE : 119;
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR = auto{ __PARA__L2 }
            for (i = ii; i < upper_bound; i++)
            {
                A[i] = 0.33333 * (B[i - 1] + B[i] + B[i + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
//
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This technique is applied to the inner loops that update arrays `A` and `B`. By processing the data in smaller tiles, we can improve cache locality and reduce memory bandwidth requirements. This is particularly beneficial for FPGA/ASIC designs where memory bandwidth can be a limiting factor. The tile size (`TILE_SIZE`) is a parameter that can be tuned based on the specific architecture and memory hierarchy of the target device.
//
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The original code updates `B` and then immediately updates `A` within the same loop iteration. By distributing these loops, we separate the computation that updates `B` from the computation that updates `A`. This transformation helps in reducing loop-carried dependencies and enables further parallelization opportunities, especially when combined with loop tiling.
//
// 3. **Parallelization Hints**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directives with the `FACTOR=auto` hint instruct the HLS tool to automatically determine the optimal parallelization factor. After applying loop tiling and loop distribution, these hints encourage the HLS tool to explore parallel execution of the independent iterations within each tile, potentially exploiting fine-grained parallelism available on the target hardware.
//
// ### Conclusion:
//
// The transformed code aims to leverage loop tiling to improve data locality, loop distribution to reduce dependencies and enable more parallel execution, and parallelization hints to guide the HLS tool in exploiting hardware parallelism. These transformations are critical for optimizing the code for high-performance FPGA/ASIC implementations, where efficient use of memory bandwidth and parallel execution capabilities are key to achieving high throughput.
