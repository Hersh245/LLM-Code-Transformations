// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gemm(int ni, int nj, int nk, double alpha, double beta, double C[60][70], double A[60][80], double B[80][70]) {
    int i, j, k;

    // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
    // Tiling factors are chosen based on the target architecture's memory hierarchy and available resources.
    int TILE_I = 20; // Example tile size for the I dimension, should be tuned based on the target device
    int TILE_J = 14; // Example tile size for the J dimension
    int TILE_K = 16; // Example tile size for the K dimension

    // Loop permutation is applied to interchange the loops to bring the j loop outside.
    // This is done to exploit spatial locality in accessing elements of C and B.
    for (int ii = 0; ii < ni; ii += TILE_I) {
        for (int jj = 0; jj < nj; jj += TILE_J) {
            for (int kk = 0; kk < nk; kk += TILE_K) {
                // Loop tiling inner loops
                for (i = ii; i < ((ii + TILE_I) < ni ? (ii + TILE_I) : ni); i++) {
                    for (k = kk; k < ((kk + TILE_K) < nk ? (kk + TILE_K) : nk); k++) {
                        // Distributing the loop to separate the multiplication and addition
                        // This loop handles the beta scaling of C
                        if (kk == 0) { // Ensure we only scale C once per full K iteration
                            for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_J) < nj ? (jj + TILE_J) : nj); j++) {
                                C[i][j] *= beta;
                            }
                        }
                        // This loop handles the alpha*A*B addition
                        for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_J) < nj ? (jj + TILE_J) : nj); j++) {
                            C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** This transformation breaks the loops into smaller blocks, which can significantly improve data locality and cache utilization. It's especially beneficial for matrices that don't fit entirely in the cache. The choice of tile sizes (`TILE_I`, `TILE_J`, `TILE_K`) depends on the specific architecture and should be tuned for optimal performance.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation:** The loops are re-ordered to bring the `j` loop outside in the tiled loops. This change aims to improve spatial locality, especially for accesses to `C` and `B`, as consecutive iterations of the `j` loop access contiguous memory locations.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution:** The initial scaling of `C` by `beta` and the addition of `alpha * A[i][k] * B[k][j]` to `C[i][j]` are separated into two distinct loops. This separation allows the `beta` scaling of `C` to be performed just once for each element of `C` per complete iteration over `k`, rather than redundantly in every iteration of the innermost loop. This optimization is particularly effective because it reduces unnecessary computations.
// 
// 4. **Conditional Execution:** A conditional check is added to ensure that the scaling of `C` by `beta` is only performed once for each element of `C` at the beginning of the computation over the `k` dimension (`if (kk == 0)`). This avoids redundant scaling operations.
// 
// ### Rationale:
// 
// These transformations aim to enhance parallelism, reduce memory access latency, and optimize the use of on-chip resources. By improving data locality through loop tiling and permutation, the transformed code can achieve higher throughput and lower memory bandwidth requirements. Additionally, loop distribution and conditional execution minimize redundant computations, further enhancing performance.
// 
// It's important to note that the optimal tile sizes and specific transformations can vary depending on the target hardware architecture, the size of the matrices involved, and the available memory hierarchy. Therefore, further tuning and experimentation may be required to achieve the best performance on a specific platform.
