// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, reduce memory access latency, and enhance data reuse. The transformations applied here include loop tiling, loop distribution, and loop permutation. These transformations aim to make the code more amenable to hardware acceleration by improving data locality and enabling more efficient use of on-chip resources.

void kernel_bicg(int m, int n, double A[410][390], double s[390], double q[410], double p[390], double r[410]) {
    int i, j;
    double temp_s[390];
    double temp_q[410];

    // Initialize accumulators
    for (i = 0; i < 390; i++) {
        temp_s[i] = 0.0;
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 410; i++) {
        temp_q[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // Loop tiling for improved data locality and parallelism
    int TILE_SIZE = 32; // Example tile size, can be adjusted based on the target architecture
    for (int ii = 0; ii < 410; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (int jj = 0; jj < 390; jj += TILE_SIZE) {

            // Loop distribution to separate the accumulation operations
            // This allows for independent optimization of each loop nest

            // Distributed loop for 's' accumulation
            for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 410; i++) {
                for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 390; j++) {
                    temp_s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
                }
            }

            // Distributed loop for 'q' accumulation
            for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 410; i++) {
                for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 390; j++) {
                    temp_q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Copy the temporary accumulators back to the original arrays
    for (i = 0; i < 390; i++) {
        s[i] = temp_s[i];
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 410; i++) {
        q[i] = temp_q[i];
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is applied to both the `i` and `j` loops to improve data locality and cache usage. By processing the data in smaller blocks (tiles), we ensure that the data used by the computation fits into the cache, reducing memory access latency and increasing the opportunity for parallel execution.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The original nested loop performs two distinct operations: updating `s[j]` and updating `q[i]`. By distributing the loop, we separate these two operations into different loop nests. This allows for more focused optimization strategies for each operation and can help in reducing dependencies and improving parallelism.
// 
// 3. **Initialization of Accumulators**: Instead of initializing `s` and `q` directly, temporary arrays (`temp_s` and `temp_q`) are used. This is done to ensure that the write operations to `s` and `q` are not a bottleneck and to facilitate the use of reduction patterns in hardware.
// 
// 4. **Loop Permutation**: Although not explicitly applied here as a separate step, loop tiling inherently involves permutation when choosing which loop to tile and how to order the tiled loops. The choice of tiling and the order of loops can significantly impact performance and should be tailored to the target hardware architecture.
// 
// These transformations aim to make the code more suitable for HLS by improving parallelism, reducing memory access times, and making better use of on-chip memory. The specific parameters (like `TILE_SIZE`) and the decision to use certain transformations over others should be guided by the target hardware's characteristics and the specific requirements of the application.
