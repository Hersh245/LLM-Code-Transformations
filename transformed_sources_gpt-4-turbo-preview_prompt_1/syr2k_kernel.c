// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation breaks the loops into smaller chunks or "tiles", which can significantly improve cache utilization and reduce memory access latency. By processing data in smaller blocks, we ensure that the working set fits into the faster, on-chip memory, leading to better performance. The tiling factors (`TILE_SIZE_I`, `TILE_SIZE_J`, `TILE_SIZE_K`) are chosen based on the target architecture's memory hierarchy and available resources.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the order of loops can lead to more efficient memory access patterns. By accessing memory in a linear and sequential manner, we can take advantage of spatial locality, leading to fewer cache misses.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion**: Merging operations that work on the same dataset into a single loop nest can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality. However, in this transformation, we actually perform loop distribution (separating operations into different loops) first to isolate the scaling of `C` by `beta` from the update operation. This is because these operations have different access patterns and computational intensities, and separating them allows for more focused optimization strategies for each part.
// 
// 4. **Loop Distribution**: Initially, the code scales `C[i][j]` by `beta` and then updates `C[i][j]` in the same loop nest. By distributing the loops, we separate these concerns, allowing for more targeted optimizations for each part. This also makes it clearer to the HLS tool how to parallelize and pipeline these operations effectively.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is better structured for parallel execution and efficient memory access, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA devices through HLS.
