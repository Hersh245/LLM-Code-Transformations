// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations like loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we aim to improve parallelism, reduce memory access latency, and enhance data locality. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m, int n, double A[116][124], double x[124], double y[124], double tmp[116]) {
  int i, j;
  
  // Initialize y to 0
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++)
    y[i] = 0.0;

  // Loop tiling to improve cache locality and enable more efficient use of memory bandwidth
  int TILE_SIZE = 32; // Example tile size, can be adjusted based on the target architecture
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 116; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    int upper_i = ii + TILE_SIZE > 116 ? 116 : ii + TILE_SIZE;

    for (int jj = 0; jj < 124; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
      int upper_j = jj + TILE_SIZE > 124 ? 124 : jj + TILE_SIZE;

      // Process tile
      for (i = ii; i < upper_i; i++) {
        tmp[i] = 0.0;

        for (j = jj; j < upper_j; j++) {
          tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
      }

      for (i = ii; i < upper_i; i++) {
        for (j = jj; j < upper_j; j++) {
          y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** This transformation is applied to both the `i` and `j` loops. Loop tiling helps in breaking down the loops into smaller chunks or "tiles" that can fit into the cache, thereby reducing cache misses and improving cache locality. It is particularly beneficial for loops accessing large arrays, as in this case. The choice of `TILE_SIZE` depends on the specific architecture and cache sizes; it requires experimentation to find the optimal value.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution:** Although not explicitly applied in a separate step here, loop tiling inherently distributes the computation across smaller chunks. This can help in reducing dependency across iterations and can make it easier to apply further optimizations like parallelization within tiles.
// 
// 3. **Parallelism:** The original code already includes pragmas to hint at parallel execution (`#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL`). After tiling, these hints could be adjusted or more specifically targeted within each tile to exploit fine-grained parallelism. This is especially true if the target architecture supports executing multiple operations in parallel within a tile.
// 
// 4. **Memory Access Optimization:** By working on smaller chunks of the data at a time (tiles), this approach optimizes memory accesses, as the working set of a tile is more likely to stay in the faster cache memory during computation. This reduces the time spent fetching data from the slower main memory.
// 
// 5. **Loop Permutation:** Not applied here because the optimal loop order (i-j) is already used considering the memory access pattern (row-major order in C). Changing the loop order could potentially worsen the performance due to non-contiguous memory accesses.
// 
// ### Note
// The effectiveness of these optimizations depends on the specifics of the hardware architecture, the size of the working set relative to cache sizes, and the compiler's ability to exploit these hints. Profiling and iterative testing are crucial to fine-tune these parameters (`TILE_SIZE`, parallel factors, etc.) for a specific target.
