// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_seidel_2d(int tsteps, int n, double A[120][120]) {
  int t, i, j, ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 16; // Define a tile size, assuming it's a divisor of 120 for simplicity

  for (t = 0; t <= 39; t++) {
    // Loop tiling for i and j loops
    for (ii = 1; ii <= 118; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
      for (jj = 1; jj <= 118; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
        // Loop ordering to ensure data locality and enable parallel execution
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
        for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i <= 118; i++) {
          for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j <= 118; j++) {
            // Computation remains the same
            A[i][j] = (A[i - 1][j - 1] + A[i - 1][j] + A[i - 1][j + 1] + A[i][j - 1] + A[i][j] + A[i][j + 1] + A[i + 1][j - 1] + A[i + 1][j] + A[i + 1][j + 1]) / 9.0;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** This transformation is applied to the `i` and `j` loops. By dividing the loops into smaller blocks (tiles), we can improve cache locality and make it easier to exploit parallelism. The choice of `TILE_SIZE` is crucial and should be tuned based on the target architecture's cache size and other specifics. In this example, I've arbitrarily chosen 16, but in a real optimization scenario, this would require experimentation.
// 
// 2. **Loop Ordering:** After tiling, the loop ordering is adjusted to first iterate over tiles and then over the elements within each tile. This ordering further improves data locality, as it ensures that data loaded into cache for processing one tile is reused as much as possible before moving on to the next tile.
// 
// 3. **Pragma Directives for Parallelism and Pipelining:** The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto` directive is applied to the innermost loop nest to suggest that the compiler should attempt to pipeline this loop. Pipelining is a technique where multiple iterations of a loop are overlapped in execution, potentially leading to significant speedups. The specific pragmas for tiling and parallel factors are removed to simplify the example, but in practice, tuning these pragmas (or letting the HLS tool automatically handle them) is essential for achieving optimal performance.
// 
// ### Rationale Behind the Transformations:
// 
// - **Improving Data Locality:** By using loop tiling, we ensure that the working set of data for each tile fits into the cache, reducing memory access latency and improving overall performance.
// - **Exploiting Parallelism:** The transformed code is structured in a way that makes it easier for the HLS tool to identify opportunities for parallel execution, both at the level of executing different tiles in parallel and within the computation inside each tile.
// - **Enhancing Pipelining:** Applying pipelining directives encourages the HLS compiler to overlap loop iterations, which can significantly increase the throughput of the computation.
// 
// These transformations, when applied thoughtfully in the context of the target hardware's specifics, can lead to substantial performance improvements in the synthesized hardware design.
