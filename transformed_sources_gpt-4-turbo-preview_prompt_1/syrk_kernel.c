// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations aimed at improving parallelism, reducing memory access latency, and increasing data reuse. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and cache usage.
  // It can also help in making better use of parallel hardware resources.
  // The tile sizes (TILE_I, TILE_J, TILE_K) are to be determined based on the target architecture's specifics.
  const int TILE_I = 10; // Example tile size, adjust based on actual hardware constraints
  const int TILE_J = 10;
  const int TILE_K = 15;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 80; ii += TILE_I) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 80; jj += TILE_J) {

      // Loop distribution applied here to separate the multiplication and addition operations.
      // This allows for independent optimization of each loop nest.
      // First, scale the C matrix by beta
      for (int i = ii; i < ii + TILE_I; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
        for (int j = jj; j < jj + TILE_J; j++) {
          if (j <= i) {
            C[i][j] *= beta;
          }
        }
      }

      // Then, perform the matrix multiplication and addition
      for (int kk = 0; kk < 60; kk += TILE_K) {
        for (int i = ii; i < ii + TILE_I; i++) {
          for (int k = kk; k < kk + TILE_K; k++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
            for (int j = jj; j < jj + TILE_J; j++) {
              if (j <= i) {
                C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** This transformation helps in optimizing memory access patterns by working on smaller, contiguous blocks of data that fit into the cache, reducing cache misses. It's particularly effective for nested loops over large data sets. The choice of tile size (`TILE_I`, `TILE_J`, `TILE_K`) is crucial and should be based on the specifics of the target architecture, such as cache size and cache line size.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution:** By distributing the loops, we separate the operations that scale matrix `C` by `beta` from those that perform the matrix multiplication and accumulate the result. This separation allows for independent optimization of each part, such as applying different parallelization strategies or further loop transformations.
// 
// 3. **Parallelization Hints (`#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto`):** These directives suggest to the HLS tool that the loops can be parallelized. The actual factor of parallelism is left for the tool to decide (`auto`), which can be useful when the optimal factor is not known in advance or may vary depending on the target hardware.
// 
// 4. **Pipeline Directive (`#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto`):** This directive suggests that the HLS tool should attempt to pipeline the outer loops, allowing for different iterations of the loop to be executed in an overlapped manner. This can significantly increase the throughput of the loop, especially in hardware implementations.
// 
// By applying these transformations and directives, the code is better structured for HLS tools to exploit parallelism and optimize memory access patterns, which can lead to more efficient hardware implementations.
