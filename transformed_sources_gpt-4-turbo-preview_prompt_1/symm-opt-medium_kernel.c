// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_symm(double alpha, double beta, double C[200][240], double A[200][200], double B[200][240]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // It can also help in making better use of parallel execution resources.
  int TILE_SIZE_I = 10; // Example tile size, can be tuned based on the target architecture
  int TILE_SIZE_J = 12; // Example tile size, can be tuned based on the target architecture
  int TILE_SIZE_K = 10; // Example tile size, can be tuned based on the target architecture

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 200; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 240; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {
      
      // Loop distribution is applied here to separate the two innermost loops.
      // This transformation helps in isolating different dependencies and can make it easier to apply further optimizations.
      
      // First distributed loop
      for (i = ii; i < min(ii + TILE_SIZE_I, 200); i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
        for (j = jj; j < min(jj + TILE_SIZE_J, 240); j++) {
          double tmp = B[i][j];
          for (k = 0; k < i; k++) {
            C[k][j] += alpha * tmp * A[i][k];
          }
        }
      }
      
      // Second distributed loop
      for (i = ii; i < min(ii + TILE_SIZE_I, 200); i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
        for (j = jj; j < min(jj + TILE_SIZE_J, 240); j++) {
          double temp2 = 0;
          for (k = 0; k < i; k++) {
            temp2 += B[k][j] * A[i][k];
          }
          C[i][j] = beta * C[i][j] + alpha * B[i][j] * A[i][i] + alpha * temp2;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** This technique is used to improve cache utilization by processing the matrix in smaller blocks that fit into the cache. This can significantly reduce the number of cache misses and improve the performance of memory-bound operations. The choice of tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I`, `TILE_SIZE_J`, and `TILE_SIZE_K`) is crucial and should be tuned based on the specific architecture and its cache hierarchy.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution:** This transformation splits the original loop into multiple loops, each performing a part of the work of the original loop. It's applied to separate the updates to `C[k][j]` and the computation of `temp2` followed by the update to `C[i][j]`. This can help in reducing loop dependencies and making it easier to exploit parallelism. It also allows for more focused optimizations on each loop.
// 
// 3. **Parallelism Annotations:** The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto` directive hints at the HLS tool to automatically determine the optimal factor of parallelism for the loop. This is crucial for exploiting data-level parallelism and improving the throughput of the computation.
// 
// 4. **Pipeline Annotation:** The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto` directive is used to allow the HLS tool to pipeline the outer loops, reducing the initiation interval (II) and increasing the throughput of the loop nest.
// 
// ### Note:
// The choice of tile sizes and the parallelism factor should be based on the target hardware characteristics and might require empirical tuning for optimal performance. Additionally, the use of `min` function in loop bounds ensures that the tiled loops do not access out-of-bounds memory when the matrix dimensions are not perfectly divisible by the tile sizes.
