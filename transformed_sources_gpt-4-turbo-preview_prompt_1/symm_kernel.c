// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Below, I'll apply loop permutation, loop tiling, and loop distribution to the code and explain the rationale behind each transformation.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_symm_optimized(double alpha, double beta, double C[60][80], double A[60][60], double B[60][80]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop tiling parameters
  const int TILE_SIZE_I = 10;
  const int TILE_SIZE_J = 16;
  const int TILE_SIZE_K = 15;

  // Loop tiling for i and j loops
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 60; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 80; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {

      // Loop permutation: moving k loop outside to improve data locality
      for (int kk = 0; kk < 60; kk += TILE_SIZE_K) {

        // Tiled loops
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
        for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_I && i < 60; i++) {
          for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < 80; j++) {
            double temp2 = 0.0;

            // Loop distribution: Splitting the k-loop to separate the dependency
            // First part: Depends on k < i
            for (k = kk; k < kk + TILE_SIZE_K && k < 60; k++) {
              if (k < i) {
                C[k][j] += alpha * B[i][j] * A[i][k];
                temp2 += B[k][j] * A[i][k];
              }
            }

            // Second part: Independent of k < i condition, moved outside the k-loop
            if (kk == 0) { // Ensure this is only added once per i,j iteration
              C[i][j] = beta * C[i][j] + alpha * B[i][j] * A[i][i] + alpha * temp2;
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This technique involves breaking down the loops into smaller blocks or "tiles". It improves data locality by working on a smaller subset of data that fits better in cache, reducing memory access times. The choice of tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I`, `TILE_SIZE_J`, `TILE_SIZE_K`) depends on the specific hardware characteristics and requires experimentation for optimal values.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can significantly impact performance, especially in terms of data locality and cache usage. By moving the `k` loop outside, we aim to reuse the data in `A` and `B` more effectively, as these elements are accessed multiple times across iterations of `i` and `j`.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This transformation splits a loop into multiple loops over the same range but with different loop bodies. It's applied here to separate the computation that depends on the condition `k < i` from the computation that doesn't. This allows for more straightforward parallelization and optimization opportunities, as dependencies are reduced.
// 
// 4. **Pragma Directives**: The use of `#pragma ACCEL` directives like `PIPELINE`, `TILE`, and `PARALLEL` instructs the HLS tool to apply specific optimizations like pipelining (executing multiple iterations of a loop in parallel), tiling (as explained above), and parallel execution. The `auto` keyword delegates the decision of specific factors to the HLS tool, which can often make efficient choices based on the target architecture.
// 
// Each of these transformations aims to improve the performance of the code when synthesized to hardware, taking advantage of parallelism, reducing latency, and improving data throughput. However, the optimal configuration of these transformations and the specific pragma parameters often require experimentation and analysis of the synthesized hardware to fine-tune.
