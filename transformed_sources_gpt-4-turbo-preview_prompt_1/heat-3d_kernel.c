// To optimize the provided code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and reduce the latency of memory accesses. Here's how we can apply these transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation helps in improving cache locality by processing data in smaller blocks. It's especially useful in nested loops where large datasets are processed.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can sometimes improve data locality and enable further optimizations like vectorization.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion**: Combining two separate loops that have the same loop bounds into a single loop can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality.
// 
// 4. **Loop Distribution**: Splitting a loop that performs two or more different computations into separate loops can sometimes enable other optimizations like loop tiling or parallelization.
// 
// Given the code snippet, we'll focus on loop tiling as it's explicitly mentioned and seems to be the primary optimization target. Loop permutation might not be directly applicable here due to the dependencies in the calculations. Loop fusion is not applicable as we don't have separate loops that can be combined without changing the logic. Loop distribution is already implicitly applied by having separate loops for updating `A` and `B`.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with loop tiling applied:

  int t, i, j, k;
  int ii, jj, kk;
  int TILE_SIZE = 4; // Example tile size, can be tuned for specific architectures

  for (t = 1; t <= 40; t++) {
    // Loop tiling for B calculation
    for (i = 1; i < 20 - 1; i += TILE_SIZE) {
      for (j = 1; j < 20 - 1; j += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (k = 1; k < 20 - 1; k += TILE_SIZE) {
          for (ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii < 20 - 1; ii++) {
            for (jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE && jj < 20 - 1; jj++) {
              for (kk = k; kk < k + TILE_SIZE && kk < 20 - 1; kk++) {
                B[ii][jj][kk] = 0.125 * (A[ii + 1][jj][kk] - 2.0 * A[ii][jj][kk] + A[ii - 1][jj][kk]) +
                                0.125 * (A[ii][jj + 1][kk] - 2.0 * A[ii][jj][kk] + A[ii][jj - 1][kk]) +

                                A[ii][jj][kk];
              }
            }
          }

    }

    // Loop tiling for A calculation
    for (i = 1; i < 20 - 1; i += TILE_SIZE) {

        for (k = 1; k < 20 - 1; k += TILE_SIZE) {

// Rationale behind the transformations:
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: By processing the data in smaller blocks (`TILE_SIZE`), we can potentially improve the cache hit rate, as the working set of the data fits better into the cache. This is particularly beneficial for the nested loops accessing multi-dimensional arrays.
// - **TILE_SIZE**: The choice of `TILE_SIZE` is crucial. It should be chosen based on the architecture's cache size and the specific problem size to ensure the best performance. Experimentation or analytical modeling may be required to find the optimal tile size.
// 
// This transformation keeps the computation the same but aims to improve the performance by optimizing memory access patterns and potentially enabling better parallel execution.
