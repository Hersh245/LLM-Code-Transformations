// To optimize the provided code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latencies. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This technique breaks down loops into smaller chunks or "tiles" to improve cache utilization and reduce memory access times. It's especially useful for large matrices.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Swapping the order of nested loops can sometimes improve data locality and access patterns, depending on how data is laid out in memory.
// 
// 3. **Loop Unrolling**: This technique involves duplicating the body of the loop a fixed number of times to reduce the overhead of loop control and increase the level of parallelism.
// 
// 4. **Array Partitioning**: This directive can be added to instruct the HLS tool to partition arrays in a way that allows parallel access, reducing access bottlenecks.
// 
// Given these strategies, let's apply them to the provided code. Note that not all transformations might be directly applicable or beneficial without specific hardware details, but we'll make general optimizations:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_mvt(double x1[400],double x2[400],double y_1[400],double y_2[400],double A[400][400])
{
  int i, j, ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 20; // Example tile size, can be tuned for specific hardware
  
  // Assuming array partitioning is beneficial for the target architecture
  #pragma ACCEL ARRAY_PARTITION variable=x1 cyclic factor=10
  #pragma ACCEL ARRAY_PARTITION variable=x2 cyclic factor=10
  #pragma ACCEL ARRAY_PARTITION variable=y_1 cyclic factor=10
  #pragma ACCEL ARRAY_PARTITION variable=y_2 cyclic factor=10
  #pragma ACCEL ARRAY_PARTITION variable=A block factor=10 dim=2

  // Loop tiling for the first loop nest
  for (i = 0; i < 400; i += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (j = 0; j < 400; j += TILE_SIZE) {
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
      for (ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii < 400; ii++) {
        for (jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE && jj < 400; jj++) {
          x1[ii] += A[ii][jj] * y_1[jj];
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Loop tiling for the second loop nest
  for (i = 0; i < 400; i += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (j = 0; j < 400; j += TILE_SIZE) {
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
      for (ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii < 400; ii++) {
        for (jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE && jj < 400; jj++) {
          x2[ii] += A[jj][ii] * y_2[jj];
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to both loop nests to improve data locality and cache usage. This can significantly reduce the time spent on memory accesses for large matrices.
// - **Array Partitioning**: This directive is used to suggest to the HLS tool that it should partition the arrays in a specific way (either cyclically or in blocks) to enable parallel access to different parts of the arrays. This can help in reducing memory access bottlenecks.
// - **Pipeline Directive**: Used within the tiled loops to further increase parallelism by allowing different iterations of the loop to be executed in an overlapped manner. This is crucial for achieving high throughput in hardware.
// 
// These transformations aim to optimize the code for parallel execution in hardware, taking advantage of HLS features to improve performance. The specific parameters (like `TILE_SIZE` and partition factors) should be tuned based on the target hardware and the specific requirements of the application.
