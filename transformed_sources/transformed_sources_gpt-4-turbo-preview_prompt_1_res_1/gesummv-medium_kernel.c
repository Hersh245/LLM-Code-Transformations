// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, reduce memory access latency, and enhance data reuse. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gesummv(double alpha, double beta, double A[250][250], double B[250][250], double tmp[250], double x[250], double y[250])
{
    int i, j, ii, jj;
    const int TILE_SIZE = 50; // Example tile size, can be tuned for specific hardware

    double temp_tmp[TILE_SIZE];
    double temp_y[TILE_SIZE];

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

    for (i = 0; i < 250; i += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (j = 0; j < 250; j += TILE_SIZE) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
            for (ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii < 250; ii++) {
                temp_tmp[ii - i] = 0.0;
                temp_y[ii - i] = 0.0;
                for (jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE && jj < 250; jj++) {
                    temp_tmp[ii - i] += A[ii][jj] * x[jj];
                    temp_y[ii - i] += B[ii][jj] * x[jj];
                }
            }

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
            for (ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii < 250; ii++) {
                tmp[ii] += temp_tmp[ii - i];
                y[ii] += temp_y[ii - i];
            }
        }
    }

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (i = 0; i < 250; i++) {
        y[i] = alpha * tmp[i] + beta * y[i];
    }
}
// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation breaks the loops over `i` and `j` into smaller chunks or "tiles". This is beneficial for several reasons:
//    - It can enhance data locality, making better use of the cache by working on smaller subsets of the data that fit into the cache.
//    - It provides opportunities for parallel execution within the tiles.
//    - The `TILE_SIZE` is a parameter that can be tuned based on the specific hardware's cache size and architecture to achieve optimal performance.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The last operation `y[i] = alpha * tmp[i] + beta * y[i];` has been moved outside of the main loop nest. This allows the main computational loops to focus on the accumulation operations without mixing different types of operations. This separation can help with optimization and parallelization, as the final scaling and addition can be efficiently pipelined or parallelized separately.
// 
// 3. **Parallelization Hints**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directives with `FACTOR=auto` are strategically placed to suggest to the HLS tool where parallel execution can be beneficial. By placing these pragmas at different loop levels, we give the HLS tool the flexibility to exploit parallelism at both the outer loop level (working on different tiles in parallel) and the inner loop level (working on elements within a tile in parallel).
// 
// 4. **Pipeline Hint**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directive is used to suggest that the HLS tool should pipeline the outermost loop. Pipelining allows different iterations of the loop to be executed in an overlapped manner, potentially leading to significant speedups. The `auto` option lets the HLS tool decide the best way to implement pipelining based on its analysis.
// 
// ### Rationale:
// 
// The main goal of these transformations is to optimize the code for HLS by improving data locality, enabling efficient use of on-chip resources, and maximizing parallel execution opportunities. Loop tiling helps to work on data subsets that fit into fast on-chip memory, reducing memory access latency. Loop distribution allows for more straightforward parallelization and pipelining by separating different types of operations. Finally, providing explicit parallelization and pipelining hints to the HLS tool helps it understand the developer's intent and optimize the hardware implementation accordingly.
