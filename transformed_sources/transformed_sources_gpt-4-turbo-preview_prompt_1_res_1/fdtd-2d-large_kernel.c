// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latency. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax, int nx, int ny, double ex[200][240], double ey[200][240], double hz[200][240], double _fict_[100]) {
    int t, i, j;
    
    // Define tile sizes for loop tiling
    const int TILE_SIZE_I = 10; // Example tile size for i dimension
    const int TILE_SIZE_J = 12; // Example tile size for j dimension
    
    for (t = 0; t < 100; t++) {
        // Apply loop tiling to improve data locality and enable parallel execution
        for (int ti = 0; ti < nx; ti += TILE_SIZE_I) {
            for (int tj = 0; tj < ny; tj += TILE_SIZE_J) {
                
                // Loop fusion for ey update to reduce the number of loops
                // and improve data locality
                for (i = ti; i < ti + TILE_SIZE_I && i < nx; i++) {
                    for (j = tj; j < tj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < ny; j++) {
                        if (i == 0) {
                            ey[i][j] = _fict_[t];
                        } else {
                            ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);
                        }
                    }
                }
                
                // Loop fusion for ex update
                for (i = ti; i < ti + TILE_SIZE_I && i < nx; i++) {
                    for (j = tj + 1; j < tj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < ny; j++) { // Start from j = 1
                        ex[i][j] = ex[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]);
                    }
                }
                
                // Loop fusion for hz update
                for (i = ti; i < ti + TILE_SIZE_I && i < nx - 1; i++) { // nx - 1 for boundary condition
                    for (j = tj; j < tj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < ny - 1; j++) { // ny - 1 for boundary condition
                        hz[i][j] = hz[i][j] - 0.7 * (ex[i][j + 1] - ex[i][j] + ey[i + 1][j] - ey[i][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation breaks the loops into smaller chunks or tiles. It improves data locality by working on a smaller subset of data that fits into the cache, reducing memory access latency. This is particularly beneficial for the nested loops iterating over `i` and `j`, where accessing `ex`, `ey`, and `hz` arrays can benefit from data being closer in memory.
// 
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: We've combined updates to `ey`, `ex`, and `hz` within the same tiled loops where possible. This reduces the number of loop iterations and improves data locality since the data required for each update is more likely to be in the cache due to recent access. It also reduces the overhead of loop control.
// 
// 3. **Parallelism**: The original code hints at parallelism with `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directives. While explicit parallelism directives are not added in the transformed code (since syntax can vary based on the target HLS tool), the transformations applied (especially loop tiling) facilitate parallel execution. The smaller, independent tiles can potentially be processed in parallel, given hardware support.
// 
// 4. **Boundary Conditions**: Care is taken to ensure that the transformed loops respect the original array boundaries, especially after loop tiling and fusion. This is crucial to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
// 
// These transformations aim to make the code more amenable to high-level synthesis optimizations, such as pipelining and parallel execution, while ensuring data locality and reducing memory access latency.
