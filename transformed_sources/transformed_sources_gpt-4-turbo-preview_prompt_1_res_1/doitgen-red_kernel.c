// To optimize the provided C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. The transformations I'll apply are:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This involves changing the order of loops to improve data locality or to make it more amenable to other optimizations like tiling or parallelization.
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique breaks down loops into smaller chunks or tiles, which can improve cache utilization and enable more efficient parallel execution.
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This separates independent computations within a loop into separate loops, which can then be optimized individually.
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: This combines multiple loops over the same range into a single loop to reduce loop overhead and improve data locality.
// 
// Given the original code and its annotations for acceleration, here's how we might transform it:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(double A[25][20][30], double C4[30][30], double sum[30]) {
    int r, q, p, s;

    // Loop permutation is not directly applicable here due to the nature of the computation.
    // The original loop order seems to be optimal for the given computation pattern.

    // Applying loop tiling to the 'r' and 'q' loops for better cache locality and parallelism
    int TILE_SIZE_R = 5; // Example tile size, should be tuned based on the target architecture
    int TILE_SIZE_Q = 10; // Example tile size

    for (int rt = 0; rt < 25; rt += TILE_SIZE_R) {
        for (int qt = 0; qt < 20; qt += TILE_SIZE_Q) {

            // Tiled loops
            for (r = rt; r < min(rt + TILE_SIZE_R, 25); r++) {
                for (q = qt; q < min(qt + TILE_SIZE_Q, 20); q++) {

                    // Inner loops remain unchanged
                    for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
                        double sum_tmp = 0.0;

                        for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
                            sum_tmp += A[r][q][s] * C4[s][p];
                        }
                        sum[p] = sum_tmp;
                    }
                    for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
                        A[r][q][p] = sum[p];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// Rationale behind transformations:
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: The outer loops (`r` and `q`) are tiled to improve data locality and enable parallel execution of tiles. The tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_R` and `TILE_SIZE_Q`) are parameters that should be tuned based on the target architecture's cache sizes and the number of available processing elements. Tiling can help in utilizing on-chip memory more effectively by working on smaller subsets of the data.
// 
// - **Loop Permutation**: In this specific case, loop permutation was not applied as the original loop order appears optimal considering the dependencies and the pattern of memory access. The computation pattern dictates that the innermost loops are tightly coupled with the computation of `sum_tmp`, making it less beneficial to permute the loops without a deeper restructuring of the algorithm.
// 
// - **Loop Fusion/Distribution**: The original code does not present clear opportunities for loop fusion or distribution that would benefit the performance without altering the semantics of the program. The two innermost loops are already optimized for their specific tasks (computation and assignment).
// 
// Note: The effectiveness of these optimizations heavily depends on the target hardware architecture. For example, the choice of tile sizes should be based on the memory hierarchy and parallel processing capabilities of the target device. Additionally, further optimizations might include exploring vectorization opportunities or adjusting the pragmas for better parallelism and pipeline configurations, which are highly dependent on the specifics of the HLS tool and target FPGA architecture.
