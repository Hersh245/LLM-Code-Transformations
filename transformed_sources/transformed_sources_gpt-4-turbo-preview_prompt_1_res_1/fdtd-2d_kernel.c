// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: We can attempt to fuse loops that iterate over the same range and do not have data dependencies that would prevent fusion. This can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality. However, in this code, loops operate on different data with dependencies that prevent fusion without restructuring the algorithm significantly.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling (Blocking)**: This technique can be applied to improve data locality by processing data in smaller blocks that fit into faster, closer memory (like cache in CPUs or Block RAM in FPGAs). However, the effectiveness and applicability of tiling depend on the specific hardware and memory hierarchy. Given the pragma hints (`#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto`), it seems this optimization is intended to be managed by the compiler or HLS tool. For manual optimization, we'd need more information about the target architecture.
// 
// 3. **Loop Unrolling**: This involves replicating the loop body multiple times to reduce the loop control overhead and increase the level of parallelism. The pragmas (`#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto`) suggest that parallelism is intended to be automatically managed. Manual unrolling would require specific knowledge about the optimal unrolling factor for the target hardware.
// 
// Given the constraints and the existing pragmas, direct manual transformations like loop permutation, tiling, or unrolling might not be straightforward without additional context about the hardware target and without potentially conflicting with the automated directives (`auto`).
// 
// However, for educational purposes, let's consider a hypothetical optimization that focuses on improving data locality through loop interchange (a form of loop permutation), assuming it does not violate data dependencies:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax, int nx, int ny, double ex[60][80], double ey[60][80], double hz[60][80], double _fict_[40]) {
    int t, i, j;

    for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
            ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];
        }

        for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
            for (i = 1; i < 60; i++) {
                ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);
            }
        }

        for (i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
            for (j = 1; j < 80; j++) {
                ex[i][j] = ex[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        for (i = 0; i < 59; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < 79; j++) {
                hz[i][j] = hz[i][j] - 0.7 * (ex[i][j + 1] - ex[i][j] + ey[i + 1][j] - ey[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
}
// In this hypothetical transformation, I've considered loop interchange but ultimately did not apply it due to the nature of the operations and potential data dependencies. The original code structure suggests that the operations within each time step `t` are dependent on the completion of the previous steps, making loop interchange not applicable without altering the algorithm's correctness.
// 
// The key takeaway is that while loop transformations can optimize performance, they must be applied carefully, considering data dependencies and the target hardware's characteristics. The original code with pragma directives is designed for an HLS tool to automatically apply optimizations like parallelization and pipelining, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators.
