// To optimize the provided C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply various code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC hardware. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_covariance(int m, int n, double float_n, double data[100][80], double cov[80][80], double mean[80]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // Loop permutation is applied to the inner two loops to enhance parallelism and pipeline efficiency.
  
  // Calculate mean
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    mean[j] = 0.0;
    
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=mean FACTOR=auto
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      mean[j] += data[i][j];
    }
    mean[j] /= float_n;
  }
  
  // Subtract mean from data elements
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=data FACTOR=auto
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      data[i][j] -= mean[j];
    }
  }
  
  // Initialize covariance matrix to zero before the main computation
  // This loop is distributed outside to avoid redundant initialization within the nested loop.
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      cov[i][j] = 0.0;
    }
  }
  
  // Compute covariance
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    for (j = i; j < 80; j++) {
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=cov FACTOR=auto
      for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
        cov[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
      }
      cov[i][j] /= float_n - 1.0;
      
      // This condition ensures we only write to cov[j][i] if it's different from cov[i][j],
      // optimizing for cases where i == j, we avoid redundant write.
      if (i != j) {
        cov[j][i] = cov[i][j];
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Not explicitly shown in the transformed code but mentioned as a comment, loop tiling could be applied especially in the covariance computation part to enhance data locality. However, due to the relatively small loop bounds and the nature of HLS, the explicit tiling might not be necessary or beneficial without knowing the specific target architecture's memory hierarchy.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: The original code already has an optimal loop order for maximizing data locality and minimizing redundant memory accesses, especially in the computation of the mean and the subtraction of the mean from the data.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: The initialization of the `cov` matrix is separated from the main computation loop. This separation allows for better pipelining opportunities and reduces the complexity within the loop that computes the covariance, potentially improving the parallelism that can be achieved.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: There isn't a direct opportunity for loop fusion in the given code without potentially harming the parallelism or data locality. The original loops are already structured in a way that benefits from the available parallelism.
// 
// 5. **Parallelism and Reduction Pragmas**: The use of `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction` is crucial for informing the HLS tool about the opportunities for parallel execution and how to handle reductions safely. The `FACTOR=auto` hints to the HLS tool to automatically determine the optimal factor, which is hardware-dependent.
// 
// 6. **Avoiding Redundant Writes**: By adding a condition to check if `i != j` before writing to `cov[j][i]`, we minimize redundant memory writes, which can save execution time and energy, especially in hardware.
// 
// These transformations and optimizations are aimed at improving the performance of the code when synthesized to hardware, taking advantage of parallelism, and optimizing memory access patterns for FPGA or ASIC targets.
