// To optimize the provided C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_mvt(double x1[120], double x2[120], double y_1[120], double y_2[120], double A[120][120])
{
  int i, j;
  
  // Loop tiling is applied to both loops to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // The tile size is chosen based on the target FPGA's resources and the specific requirements of the application.
  // Here, we assume a tile size of 30 for demonstration purposes.
  int TILE_SIZE = 30;
  
  // Applying loop tiling to the first loop nest
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
      
      // The inner tile loops
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
      for (i = ii; i < ((ii + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (ii + TILE_SIZE) : 120); i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=x1 FACTOR=auto
        for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (jj + TILE_SIZE) : 120); j++) {
          x1[i] += A[i][j] * y_1[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Applying loop tiling to the second loop nest
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
      
      // The inner tile loops
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
      for (i = ii; i < ((ii + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (ii + TILE_SIZE) : 120); i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=x2 FACTOR=auto
        for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (jj + TILE_SIZE) : 120); j++) {
          x2[i] += A[j][i] * y_2[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation breaks the loops into smaller blocks or "tiles". It improves data locality by ensuring that the data used by one iteration of a tile is reused in the next, reducing the amount of data movement required. This is particularly effective for hardware accelerators where memory bandwidth is often a bottleneck.
// 
// 2. **Loop Pipelining**: By applying the `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directive, we instruct the HLS tool to overlap the execution of iterations of the loop, which can significantly increase the throughput of the loop. This transformation is beneficial for loops with a large number of independent iterations, as it allows for concurrent execution of different loop iterations.
// 
// 3. **Parallelism**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directive with reduction is used to indicate that iterations of the loop can be executed in parallel, with a special handling for the reduction operation on the `x1` and `x2` arrays. This exploits the parallel processing capabilities of the target hardware, allowing for multiple operations to be performed simultaneously.
// 
// By applying these transformations, we aim to make better use of the FPGA's resources, such as its ability to execute multiple operations in parallel and its fast, but limited, on-chip memory. The specific choices, like the tile size, should be further tuned based on the target hardware's characteristics and the requirements of the application.
