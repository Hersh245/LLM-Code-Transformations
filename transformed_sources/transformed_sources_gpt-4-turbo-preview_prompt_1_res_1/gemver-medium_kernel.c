// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latency. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gemver(int n, double alpha, double beta, double A[400][400], double u1[400], double v1[400], double u2[400], double v2[400], double w[400], double x[400], double y[400], double z[400])
{
    int i, j, ii, jj;
    const int TILE_SIZE = 20; // Example tile size, can be adjusted based on the target architecture

    // Loop tiling for the first loop nest to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 400; i += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (j = 0; j < 400; j += TILE_SIZE) {
            #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
            for (ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii < 400; ii++) {
                for (jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE && jj < 400; jj++) {
                    A[ii][jj] += u1[ii] * v1[jj] + u2[ii] * v2[jj];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Loop permutation in the second loop nest to enhance memory access pattern
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (j = 0; j < 400; j++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
        for (i = 0; i < 400; i++) {
            x[i] += beta * A[j][i] * y[j];
        }
    }

    // Direct parallelization of simple loop, as it's already in an efficient form
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (i = 0; i < 400; i++) {
        x[i] = x[i] + z[i];
    }

    // Loop tiling for the third loop nest to improve data locality
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 400; i += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (j = 0; j < 400; j += TILE_SIZE) {
            #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L3}
            for (ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii < 400; ii++) {
                for (jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE && jj < 400; jj++) {
                    w[ii] += alpha * A[ii][jj] * x[jj];
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling:** Applied to the first and third loop nests to break down the loops into smaller chunks (tiles). This improves data locality, making better use of the cache and reducing memory access latency. It also opens up opportunities for parallel execution of independent tiles.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation:** Applied to the second loop nest by swapping the loop order. This enhances the memory access pattern, potentially reducing cache misses. The original code accesses `A[j][i]` in an inner loop, which is not cache-friendly due to the row-major order of C arrays. Permuting the loops makes the access pattern more sequential.
// 
// 3. **Direct Parallelization:** The simple addition loop (`x[i] = x[i] + z[i];`) is already efficient for parallel execution. We directly apply parallelization pragmas to exploit data-level parallelism without further transformation.
// 
// ### Notes:
// 
// - The choice of `TILE_SIZE` can significantly impact performance and should be tuned based on the specific architecture and its cache hierarchy.
// - The `#pragma ACCEL` directives are assumed to be specific to the target HLS toolchain. They hint at parallel execution, pipelining, and other optimizations. The exact syntax and capabilities might vary between different HLS tools.
// - Ensuring that the loop bounds in tiled loops correctly handle cases where the matrix size is not a multiple of `TILE_SIZE` is crucial to avoid out-of-bounds memory access.
