// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latency, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void gemm(double m1[4096], double m2[4096], double prod[4096]) {
  int i, j, k;
  double sum;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 16; // Define a tile size for loop tiling

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  // Loop tiling for i and j loops to improve data locality and enable parallel execution
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 64; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 64; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
      
      // Initialize the tile of prod matrix
      double prod_tile[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE] = {0};
      
      for (int kk = 0; kk < 64; kk += TILE_SIZE) {
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
        for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE; i++) {
          for (k = kk; k < kk + TILE_SIZE; k++) {
            double rA = m1[i * 64 + k];
            
            for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE; j++) {
              double rB = m2[k * 64 + j];
              prod_tile[i - ii][j - jj] += rA * rB;
            }
          }
        }
      }
      
      // Store the computed tile back to the prod matrix
      for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE; i++) {
        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE; j++) {
          prod[i * 64 + j] = prod_tile[i - ii][j - jj];
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** The outer two loops (`i` and `j`) are tiled with a TILE_SIZE to improve data locality and cache utilization. This transformation divides the matrix multiplication into smaller chunks that fit into the fast on-chip memory, reducing the time spent on memory accesses.
// 
// 2. **Loop Interchange:** Inside the tiled loops, the order of the `k` loop and the `i` loop is interchanged. This is done to ensure that the accesses to `m1` are sequential, which improves spatial locality and memory access patterns.
// 
// 3. **Array Partitioning (Implicit):** Although not explicitly shown in the code through pragmas, the transformation suggests that the `prod_tile` array could be a candidate for array partitioning. This would allow multiple elements of `prod_tile` to be accessed in parallel, further improving performance. In an actual HLS tool, you would use specific pragmas or directives to partition this array.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion:** The final step of writing the `prod_tile` back to the `prod` array is kept inside the tiled loops to minimize the latency of memory operations and to keep the computations localized.
// 
// 5. **Parallelism:** The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` and `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directives are used to hint at the compiler to parallelize loops and pipeline operations within the hardware constraints. The exact factor of parallelization and pipelining would depend on the target hardware capabilities and is left as 'auto' to be determined by the HLS tool.
// 
// These transformations aim to make the code more suitable for hardware execution by improving parallelism, reducing memory access latency, and enhancing data locality, which are critical for achieving high performance on FPGA-based accelerators.
