// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and reduce latency. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void bbgemm(double m1[4096], double m2[4096], double prod[4096]) {
  int i, j, k, jj, kk;
  double temp_prod[8][8];

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (jj = 0; jj < 64; jj += 8) {
    for (kk = 0; kk < 64; kk += 8) {
      // Initialize temporary product matrix to zero at the start of each tile computation
      for (i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        for (j = 0; j < 8; ++j) {
          temp_prod[i][j] = 0.0;
        }
      }
      
      // Compute a 8x8 block of the product
      for (i = 0; i < 64; ++i) {
        for (k = 0; k < 8; ++k) {
          double temp_x = m1[i * 64 + k + kk];
          for (j = 0; j < 8; ++j) {
            temp_prod[i % 8][j] += temp_x * m2[(k + kk) * 64 + j + jj];
          }
        }
        
        // Write the computed 8x8 block back to the product matrix after every 8 iterations of i
        if ((i + 1) % 8 == 0) {
          for (int x = 0; x < 8; ++x) {
            for (int y = 0; y < 8; ++y) {
              prod[(i - 7) * 64 + x * 64 + y + jj] = temp_prod[x][y];
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: The original code already employs loop tiling, but it initializes the starting indices for `jj` and `kk` loops in a non-standard way. The optimized code uses a more conventional approach to loop tiling, iterating over `jj` and `kk` in steps of 8, which matches the original intent. This improves data locality and cache usage by working on smaller blocks of the matrices at a time.
// 
// 2. **Temporary Accumulation Matrix**: A temporary 8x8 matrix `temp_prod` is used to accumulate the results of the 8x8 block multiplication before writing them back to the `prod` matrix. This reduces the frequency of memory writes to the `prod` array, which can be costly in terms of performance. After every 8 iterations of the `i` loop, the accumulated block is written back to the `prod` matrix. This technique is a form of loop fusion, where the write-back loop is merged into the computation loop, but only executed every 8 iterations.
// 
// 3. **Loop Interchange**: The order of the `j` and `k` loops inside the `i` loop has been kept the same because it is already in an optimal form for accessing the `m1` and `m2` matrices in a row-major order, which is beneficial for spatial locality.
// 
// 4. **Loop Unrolling**: The innermost loops over `i`, `j`, and `k` could potentially be unrolled by the compiler or manually to further optimize performance. This is hinted at with the use of `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto`, suggesting that the compiler should automatically manage the unrolling and pipelining of these loops for optimal performance. The explicit loop unrolling is not shown in the transformed code for clarity, but it's a common optimization that HLS tools can perform.
// 
// 5. **Removal of Redundant Code**: The original code had lines setting `kk` and `jj` to `56 + 8L` at the end of their respective loops, which were redundant and have been removed in the optimized version.
// 
// These transformations aim to improve the efficiency of the matrix multiplication by enhancing data locality, reducing memory access latency, and enabling better opportunities for parallel execution by the HLS tool.
