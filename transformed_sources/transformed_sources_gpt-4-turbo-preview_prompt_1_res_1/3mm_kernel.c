// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_3mm(int ni, int nj, int nk, int nl, int nm, double E[40][50], double A[40][60], double B[60][50], double F[50][70], double C[50][80], double D[80][70], double G[40][70]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop tiling for matrix multiplication E := A*B
  // Tiling improves data locality and enables more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  int TILE_SIZE_E = 10; // Example tile size, adjust based on the target hardware constraints
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 40; ii += TILE_SIZE_E) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 50; jj += TILE_SIZE_E) {
      for (int kk = 0; kk < 60; kk += TILE_SIZE_E) {
        for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_E; i++) {
          for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_E; j++) {
            for (k = kk; k < kk + TILE_SIZE_E; ++k) {
              E[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Loop tiling for matrix multiplication F := C*D
  int TILE_SIZE_F = 10; // Example tile size, adjust based on the target hardware constraints
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 50; ii += TILE_SIZE_F) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 70; jj += TILE_SIZE_F) {
      for (int kk = 0; kk < 80; kk += TILE_SIZE_F) {
        for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_F; i++) {
          for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_F; j++) {
            for (k = kk; k < kk + TILE_SIZE_F; ++k) {
              F[i][j] += C[i][k] * D[k][j];
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Loop tiling for matrix multiplication G := E*F
  int TILE_SIZE_G = 10; // Example tile size, adjust based on the target hardware constraints
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 40; ii += TILE_SIZE_G) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 70; jj += TILE_SIZE_G) {
      for (int kk = 0; kk < 50; kk += TILE_SIZE_G) {
        for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_G; i++) {
          for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_G; j++) {
            for (k = kk; k < kk + TILE_SIZE_G; ++k) {
              G[i][j] += E[i][k] * F[k][j];
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** This transformation breaks down the loops into smaller blocks, improving data locality by making efficient use of the cache or local memory on the FPGA. It reduces the memory bandwidth requirements and can significantly improve performance, especially for large matrices where accessing memory is a bottleneck.
// 
// 2. **Parallelism:** The original code includes pragmas for parallelism (`#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto`). While the transformed code does not explicitly include these pragmas, the tiling transformation makes it easier to exploit parallelism at the tile level. In an HLS context, designers can use specific HLS directives (e.g., `#pragma HLS PIPELINE` or `#pragma HLS UNROLL`) within each tile's computation to further exploit parallelism and pipeline the operations.
// 
// 3. **Loop Order:** The order of the loops has been kept the same (i-j-k) for simplicity and to ensure correctness of the matrix multiplication. However, depending on the specific access patterns and the architecture of the target FPGA, experimenting with loop interchange might yield additional performance benefits, especially in terms of reducing the number of memory accesses.
// 
// 4. **TILE_SIZE Selection:** The `TILE_SIZE` for each matrix multiplication is a parameter that should be tuned based on the target hardware's specific constraints, such as the size of the on-chip memory and the available parallel compute resources. Finding the optimal tile size usually requires some experimentation and profiling.
// 
// These transformations aim to make the code more amenable to high-level synthesis optimizations, enabling better performance on FPGA hardware by improving data locality, enabling parallel execution, and making efficient use of the hardware resources.
