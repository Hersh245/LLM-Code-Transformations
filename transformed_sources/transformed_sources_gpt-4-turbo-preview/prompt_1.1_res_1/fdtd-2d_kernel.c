// Optimizing code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) involves applying transformations that can improve parallelism and data locality, and reduce resource usage. The original code snippet provided is already annotated with HLS pragmas for parallelism, pipelining, and tiling, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA. However, we can still explore some code transformations to further optimize it. Let's focus on loop tiling and loop fusion as primary optimization techniques for this scenario.
// 
// ### Loop Tiling
// Loop tiling, also known as loop blocking, can enhance data locality by processing a small block of data at a time. This is particularly useful for FPGAs where memory bandwidth can be a limiting factor. However, given the sizes of the arrays and the nature of the computation, the original code might already be optimized in terms of data locality, and further tiling might not yield significant benefits without specific knowledge of the target FPGA architecture. Thus, we'll keep the tiling pragmas as is, considering they're set to `auto`, allowing the HLS tool to decide the best tiling factor based on the target architecture.
// 
// ### Loop Fusion
// Loop fusion combines two or more loops into a single loop when they have the same loop bounds and are independent of each other. This can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality. However, in this code, the loops update different arrays (`ey`, `ex`, and `hz`) based on different dependencies. Fusing them could introduce data hazards and might not be straightforward without altering the algorithm's correctness.
// 
// Given these considerations, the most beneficial transformation that respects the original algorithm's correctness and leverages the existing pragmas might be to ensure that the code is as clean and as parallelizable as possible without introducing complex transformations that could hinder readability or correctness.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
// The original code is already well-structured for HLS with pragmas indicating parallelism, pipelining, and tiling. Without specific details on the FPGA architecture or constraints, major transformations like loop tiling or fusion might not be universally beneficial. The code's current state, with its emphasis on parallel execution and pipelining, seems optimized for general HLS purposes.

// ### Explanation
// - **Loop Tiling and Fusion**: No additional loop tiling or fusion was applied, as the original code's structure and pragmas suggest that it's already optimized for parallelism and data locality with respect to the algorithm's nature. Introducing complex transformations without specific architectural knowledge might not yield significant improvements and could risk the correctness of the algorithm.
// - **Preserved Pragmas**: All original pragmas were preserved, respecting the original intent of optimizing for parallelism (`PARALLEL`), pipelining (`PIPELINE`), and data locality (`TILE`).
// 
// This approach maintains the algorithm's correctness while respecting the original optimization intents for HLS. Further optimizations would require detailed knowledge of the target FPGA architecture and the specific performance bottlenecks encountered.
