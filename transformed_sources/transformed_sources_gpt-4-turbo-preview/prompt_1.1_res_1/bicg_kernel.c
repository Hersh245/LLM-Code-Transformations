// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations, we'll focus on improving data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency. The original code performs two main operations within a single loop nest: updating `s[j]` and `q[i]` based on the matrix `A` and vectors `r` and `p`. We'll apply loop distribution to separate these two operations, allowing for more focused optimizations on each part. Additionally, we'll consider loop tiling for the operation involving `s[j]` to improve cache efficiency, and we'll maintain the use of pragmas to guide the HLS tool in optimizing the code.
// 
// Here's the transformed code:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124]) {
  int i, j, ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 32; // Example tile size, adjust based on target architecture and memory bandwidth

  // Initialize s
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    s[i] = ((double)0);
  }

  // Initialize q
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
    q[i] = 0.0;
  }

  // Loop distribution applied here to separate the updates to s and q

  // Update s[j]
  // Loop tiling applied to improve data locality
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
  for (ii = 0; ii < 124; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    int max_i = ii + TILE_SIZE > 124 ? 124 : ii + TILE_SIZE;
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (i = ii; i < max_i; i++) {
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
      for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
        s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
      }
    }
  }

  // Update q[i]
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
    for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
      q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: By separating the updates to `s[j]` and `q[i]` into distinct loop nests, we can apply different optimizations tailored to each operation. This also helps in reducing loop-carried dependencies and improving parallelism.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling for `s[j]` Update**: Applying loop tiling to the `s[j]` update loop improves data locality by working on smaller chunks of the `A` matrix and `r` vector at a time. This can reduce cache misses and make better use of on-chip memory, which is crucial for performance in many HLS-targeted architectures.
// 
// 3. **Maintaining Pragmas**: The original pragmas for parallelism (`#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL`) and pipeline (`#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE`) are maintained and adjusted according to the transformed code structure. These pragmas are essential for guiding the HLS tool to exploit parallelism and pipeline operations effectively. The `FACTOR=auto` hints allow the HLS tool to automatically determine the optimal factor for parallelism and pipelining, which can vary depending on the specific hardware target.
// 
// 4. **Adjustable `TILE_SIZE`**: The tile size is a parameter that might need tuning based on the target architecture's memory hierarchy and available parallelism. It's set as a constant here for simplicity, but in practice, it might be determined through empirical testing or based on the specifics of the target hardware.
// 
// This transformed code aims to balance between exploiting data locality through loop tiling and enhancing parallel execution capabilities via loop distribution and the effective use of HLS pragmas.
