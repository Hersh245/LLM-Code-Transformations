// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using techniques like loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we need to consider the memory access patterns, parallelization opportunities, and the hardware resources available. The goal is to increase data locality, reduce memory access latency, and maximize the utilization of the hardware resources.
// 
// Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk_optimized(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60]) {
    int i, j, k;

    // Loop tiling to improve cache locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
    // Tile sizes are chosen based on typical cache line sizes and available on-chip memory.
    // Assuming a tile size of 20 for demonstration purposes, but this should be tuned based on the target architecture.
    int TILE_SIZE_I = 20;
    int TILE_SIZE_J = 20;
    int TILE_SIZE_K = 15;

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (int ii = 0; ii < 80; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
        for (int jj = 0; jj < 80; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {

            // Loop distribution to separate the beta scaling and the alpha addition into two distinct loops.
            // This allows for independent optimization of each loop.
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
            for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_I && i < 80; i++) {
                for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < 80; j++) {
                    if (j <= i) {
                        C[i][j] *= beta;
                    }
                }
            }

            #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
            #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
            for (int kk = 0; kk < 60; kk += TILE_SIZE_K) {
                #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
                for (k = kk; k < kk + TILE_SIZE_K && k < 60; k++) {
                    for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_I && i < 80; i++) {
                        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < 80; j++) {
                            if (j <= i) {
                                C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
                            }
                        }
                    }

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the `i`, `j`, and `k` loops to improve data locality and cache utilization. This transformation divides the loops into smaller chunks (tiles), which can help ensure that the data used by the computation fits into the cache, reducing the number of slow memory accesses. The tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I`, `TILE_SIZE_J`, `TILE_SIZE_K`) are parameters that should be tuned based on the specific architecture's cache size and memory bandwidth.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The original loop over `j` that scales `C[i][j]` by `beta` and the loop that adds the `alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k]` term are distributed into separate loops. This allows each loop to be optimized independently and can help in reducing the complexity of the control logic in the hardware implementation.
// 
// 3. **Parallelization Pragmas**: The original pragmas are kept to hint at the HLS tool for potential parallelization, pipelining, and tiling opportunities. Adjusting these pragmas based on the transformed loops and the specific target hardware can further optimize performance.
// 
// 4. **Loop Permutation**: Not explicitly applied here as loop tiling and distribution were the primary transformations. However, the order of the loops within the tiles was carefully considered to maintain the algorithm's correctness and optimize memory access patterns.
// 
// These transformations aim to optimize the use of hardware resources, improve memory access patterns, and enable more efficient parallel execution. The specific parameters like tile sizes and parallelization factors should be further tuned based on the target FPGA architecture and the available resources.
