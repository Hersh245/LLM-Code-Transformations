// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) targeting FPGA acceleration, we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to enhance parallelism, improve data locality, and reduce memory access latency. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This involves changing the loop order to improve data locality. However, in this case, due to the dependencies in the innermost loop, permutation options are limited.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique breaks down loops into smaller chunks to fit data into faster, but smaller, memory (like cache or local memory on FPGAs). It's particularly useful for the outer loops to improve data reuse.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This can separate different computations within a loop into separate loops. It's useful when different iterations of the loop can be executed in parallel.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: This combines two separate loops into one, reducing the overhead of loop control and improving data locality. However, in this code, loop fusion opportunities are limited due to the structure of the computation.
// 
// Given the structure of the original code, the most beneficial transformations appear to be loop tiling for the outer loops and possibly reordering some operations to improve data locality and parallelism. However, we must be cautious with loop permutation due to data dependencies.
// 
// Here's an example of how the code might be transformed:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(int nr,int nq,int np,double A[25][20][30],double C4[30][30],double sum[30]) {
  int r, q, p, s;
  int rr, qq; // For tiling
  int TILE_R = 5; // Example tile size for R dimension
  int TILE_Q = 5; // Example tile size for Q dimension

  //#pragma scop
  
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  for (r = 0; r < 25; r += TILE_R) { // Tiling loop for R
    
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    for (q = 0; q < 20; q += TILE_Q) { // Tiling loop for Q
      
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
      for (rr = r; rr < r + TILE_R && rr < 25; rr++) { // Inner tiled loop for R
        
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
        for (qq = q; qq < q + TILE_Q && qq < 20; qq++) { // Inner tiled loop for Q
          
          #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
          for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
            sum[p] = 0.0;
            for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
              sum[p] += A[rr][qq][s] * C4[s][p];
            }
          }
          for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
            A[rr][qq][p] = sum[p];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  //#pragma endscop
}
// **Rationale Behind Transformations:**
// 
// - **Loop Tiling for R and Q**: By introducing tiling for the `r` and `q` loops, we aim to improve data locality and make better use of on-chip memory. Smaller chunks of data are more likely to stay in faster memory, reducing access times and potentially increasing parallelism.
// 
// - **Maintaining the Original Loop Order Inside Tiles**: Due to the dependencies in the computation of `sum[p]`, we maintain the original loop order within the tiles. This ensures correctness while still aiming for improved performance through tiling.
// 
// - **Pragma Directives**: The original pragma directives for pipelining and tiling are kept to hint the HLS tool about potential parallelism and optimization opportunities. Adjusting the tile sizes (`TILE_R` and `TILE_Q`) might be necessary based on the target FPGA's resources and the specific requirements of the application.
// 
// This transformed code aims to strike a balance between exploiting data locality through tiling and maintaining the necessary order of operations for correctness. Further optimizations might include exploring different tile sizes or additional pragma directives specific to the target HLS tool and FPGA architecture.
