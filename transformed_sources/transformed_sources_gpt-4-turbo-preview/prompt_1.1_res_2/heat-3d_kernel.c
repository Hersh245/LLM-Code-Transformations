// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal of these transformations is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which can lead to better performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation breaks the loops into smaller chunks or "tiles," which can improve cache utilization and enable more efficient parallel execution. We'll apply this to the `i`, `j`, and `k` loops.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can sometimes improve data locality and access patterns. However, in this specific case, due to the nature of the computation (stencil computation), changing the loop order might not yield significant benefits without careful consideration of data dependencies. We'll keep the original order but note that exploring different permutations could be beneficial depending on the target architecture.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion/Distribution**: These transformations can be used to merge or split loops to improve parallelism or reduce memory access overhead. Given the structure of the code, there's limited scope for fusion without altering the algorithm's correctness. The code already does a good job of separating computation phases for `A` and `B`.
// 
// 4. **Parallelism**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directive hints at parallel execution. We ensure that the code structure supports parallel execution without data hazards.
// 
// Considering these points, let's focus on applying loop tiling effectively, as it's the most straightforward and impactful optimization for this stencil computation. Note that the actual tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I`, `TILE_SIZE_J`, `TILE_SIZE_K`) should be chosen based on the target hardware's characteristics and constraints (e.g., available memory). For simplicity, we'll use placeholders (`TILE_SIZE_I`, `TILE_SIZE_J`, `TILE_SIZE_K`).

// This transformed code introduces loop tiling, which can significantly improve data locality and potentially enable more efficient parallel execution on hardware accelerators. The choice of tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I`, `TILE_SIZE_J`, `TILE_SIZE_K`) is crucial and should be based on the specific characteristics of the target hardware. Experimentation and profiling are often necessary to find the optimal tile sizes.
