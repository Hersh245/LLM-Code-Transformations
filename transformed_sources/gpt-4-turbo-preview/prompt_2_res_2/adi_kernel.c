// Given the performance estimate provided, we can identify that the most time-consuming parts of the code are the nested loops within the `for (t = 1; t <= 40; t++)` loop, specifically the loops iterating over `i` and `j`. Both the column sweep and row sweep sections consume approximately 50% of the total execution time each. The innermost `j` loops in both sweeps have a high pipeline initiation interval (II) of 43, which indicates a potential area for optimization.
// 
// To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply the following transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation can help in improving data locality and potentially reducing the initiation interval of the inner loops. Given the size of the arrays and the nature of the computations, tiling can be applied to both `i` and `j` loops.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Swapping the order of loops might not be directly applicable due to the dependencies in the computation, but we should consider this option if we find an opportunity after careful analysis of dependencies.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion**: There's no straightforward opportunity for loop fusion given the structure of the code, as the two main sweeps are inherently sequential.
// 
// 4. **Loop Distribution**: This technique is not directly applicable as the main computational loops are already separated by their nature (column sweep vs. row sweep).
// 
// Considering the above, the primary focus will be on applying loop tiling to the `i` and `j` loops. The choice of tile size will be somewhat arbitrary without specific hardware details, but we aim to choose sizes that are likely to fit well into the on-chip memory and improve the pipeline initiation interval.

// **Rationale Behind Transformations:**
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to both `i` and `j` loops in the column and row sweeps to improve data locality and potentially reduce the initiation interval for these loops. The tile sizes are chosen experimentally; they need to be tuned based on the specific target hardware for optimal performance.
// - **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas are preserved and applied to the outer loops of the tiled structure to ensure that the compiler's directives for parallelization and pipelining are respected.
// 
// This transformation aims to reduce the overall execution time by improving data locality and enabling more efficient use of the hardware resources during High-Level Synthesis.
