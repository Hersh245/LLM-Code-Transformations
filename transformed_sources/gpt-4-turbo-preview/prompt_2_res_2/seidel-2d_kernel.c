// Given the performance estimates and the original code, it's clear that the majority of the execution time is spent within the nested loops. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several loop transformations. The goal is to reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC), while also considering the impact on trip count (TC). 
// 
// ### Original Performance Bottlenecks:
// 1. **Nested Loops**: The nested loops over `t`, `i`, and `j` are the primary contributors to the high cycle count.
// 2. **Memory Access**: The frequent read and write operations to the array `A` also contribute to the cycle count.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations:
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation can help with data locality and potentially reduce the number of memory accesses. It's particularly effective for nested loops that access multi-dimensional arrays.
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can improve memory access patterns, further enhancing data locality.
// 3. **Loop Fusion/Distribution**: Depending on the access patterns, fusing or distributing loops can either reduce overhead or improve parallelism.
// 
// ### Transformed Code:
// Given the nature of the Seidel 2D kernel, loop tiling seems to be the most promising optimization. Loop permutation and fusion/distribution might not offer significant benefits due to the dependencies in the computation of `A[i][j]`. However, we'll focus on applying loop tiling to the `i` and `j` loops to improve data locality and reduce memory access times.

                        A[i][j] = (A[i - 1][j - 1] + A[i - 1][j] + A[i - 1][j + 1] + A[i][j - 1] + A[i][j] + A[i][j + 1] + A[i + 1][j - 1] + A[i + 1][j] + A[i + 1][j + 1]) / 9.0;

                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale:
// - **Loop Tiling**: By introducing `ii` and `jj` as the starting points for tiles within the `i` and `j` loops, we aim to keep the working set of data small enough to fit into a cache or local memory, reducing the latency of memory accesses. The tile size of 30 is arbitrary and should be tuned based on the target architecture's cache size and memory bandwidth.
// - **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been preserved and applied to the outer loops to ensure that the compiler's HLS directives for parallelism, pipelining, and tiling are still considered during synthesis.
// 
// ### Expected Impact:
// - **Reduced Memory Access Times**: By improving data locality, the transformed code should reduce the time spent on memory accesses.
// - **Potential for Parallel Execution**: Depending on the target architecture, the tiled loops may offer better opportunities for parallel execution of independent tiles.
// 
// ### Caveats:
// - **Dependency Analysis**: Care must be taken to ensure that the chosen tile size does not introduce dependency issues. The computation of `A[i][j]` depends on neighboring elements, so the tile size and boundaries need to ensure that all required data is available when needed.
// - **Architecture-Specific Tuning**: The optimal tile size is highly dependent on the specific target architecture, including factors like cache size and memory bandwidth.
