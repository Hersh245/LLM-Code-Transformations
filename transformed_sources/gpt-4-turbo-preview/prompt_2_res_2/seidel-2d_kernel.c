// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) targeting FPGA acceleration, we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and memory access patterns to better utilize the FPGA resources. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation breaks the loops into smaller chunks, improving cache utilization and enabling more efficient use of local memory on FPGAs.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can improve memory access patterns and increase the opportunity for parallel execution.
// 
// 3. **Loop Unrolling**: This increases the level of parallelism by executing multiple iterations of a loop simultaneously. We'll apply this implicitly through the `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directive, which is already present in the code.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_seidel_2d(int tsteps, int n, double A[120][120]) {
    int t, i, j, ii, jj;
    const int TILE_SIZE = 30; // Example tile size, can be adjusted for specific FPGA resources

    //#pragma scop

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (t = 0; t <= 39; t++) {

        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}

        #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}

        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
        // Loop tiling for 'i' and 'j' loops
        for (ii = 1; ii <= 118; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
            for (jj = 1; jj <= 118; jj += TILE_SIZE) {

                // Loop permutation to access A[][] in a more locality-friendly order
                for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i <= 118; i++) {
                    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
                    for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j <= 118; j++) {
                        A[i][j] = (A[i - 1][j - 1] + A[i - 1][j] + A[i - 1][j + 1] + A[i][j - 1] + A[i][j] + A[i][j + 1] + A[i + 1][j - 1] + A[i + 1][j] + A[i + 1][j + 1]) / 9.0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    //#pragma endscop
}
// **Rationale Behind Each Transformation:**
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: By dividing the loops into smaller blocks (tiles), we can ensure that the data being worked on can fit into the FPGA's local memory (e.g., BRAM), reducing the need for slower global memory accesses. This is particularly effective for nested loops over large data arrays.
// 
// - **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order to process the data in tiles improves data locality. This means that once a data element is loaded into a local memory, it can be reused multiple times before being evicted, reducing the total number of memory accesses.
// 
// - **Implicit Loop Unrolling via `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL`**: Although not explicitly modified in the transformation, the use of `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` with the `auto` factor allows the HLS tool to automatically unroll loops to the extent that it finds optimal. This increases the level of parallelism by executing multiple operations concurrently, which is key to achieving high performance on FPGAs.
// 
// These transformations, combined with the directives for pipeline, tiling, and parallel execution, instruct the HLS tool to generate hardware that exploits parallelism, optimizes memory access patterns, and efficiently uses the FPGA resources.
