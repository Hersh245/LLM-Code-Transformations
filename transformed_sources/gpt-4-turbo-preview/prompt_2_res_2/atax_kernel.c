// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations, we'll focus on loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, and loop fusion. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance in hardware.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// The original code performs a matrix-vector multiplication followed by a vector update. It uses pragmas to hint at parallelization and pipeline optimizations but doesn't fully exploit the potential for HLS optimizations like loop unrolling, tiling for better data locality, or efficient pipelining.
// 
// ### Optimized Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m, int n, double A[116][124], double x[124], double y[124], double tmp[116]) {
    int i, j;
    // Initialize y to 0
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++)
        y[i] = ((double)0);

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        tmp[i] = 0.0;

        // Loop tiling for better data locality and cache utilization
        // Assuming a tile size of 32, which should be tuned based on the target architecture
        int TILE_SIZE = 32;
        for (int jj = 0; jj < 124; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
            for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 124; j++) {
                tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
            }
        }

        // Distributing the second loop to separate the concerns of computation and accumulation
        // This allows for better optimization opportunities for each part
        for (int jj = 0; jj < 124; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
            for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 124; j++) {
                y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is applied to both the computation of `tmp` and the update of `y`. Loop tiling improves data locality by working on smaller, contiguous blocks of data that fit into the cache, reducing memory access times. The tile size of 32 is arbitrary and should be tuned based on the specific architecture's cache size and characteristics.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The original code combines the computation of `tmp[i]` and the update of `y[j]` within the same loop nest. By distributing these loops, we separate the concerns of computation (calculating `tmp[i]`) and accumulation (updating `y[j]`). This separation allows for more focused optimizations on each part and can improve parallelism and pipelining opportunities.
// 
// 3. **Parallelism and Pipelining Pragmas**: The original pragmas are retained and applied to the transformed loops to hint at the compiler for automatic parallelization and pipelining optimizations. These pragmas suggest to the HLS tool that it should attempt to unroll loops and pipeline operations where possible, based on the hardware resources available.
// 
// ### Conclusion
// The transformed code aims to exploit data locality through loop tiling and improve parallelism by distributing loops and applying targeted pragmas. These transformations are crucial for optimizing the code for HLS, where memory access patterns and parallel execution significantly impact performance. However, the exact tile size and parallelism factors (`FACTOR=auto`) should be further tuned based on the target hardware's specific characteristics and resource availability.
