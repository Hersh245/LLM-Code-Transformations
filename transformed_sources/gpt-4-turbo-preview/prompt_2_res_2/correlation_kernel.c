// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we will apply several code transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, and loop fusion. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance in hardware implementations.
// 
// ### Original Code Review
// 
// The original code performs a series of operations to calculate the correlation matrix for a given dataset. It includes:
// - Calculation of means for each column.
// - Calculation of standard deviations for each column.
// - Centering and reducing the column vectors.
// - Calculation of the correlation matrix.
// 
// ### Optimizations
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: We can combine loops that have the same loop bounds and are independent of each other to reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: For complex loops, distributing them can help in isolating independent operations, which can then be parallelized or pipelined more effectively.
// 
// 3. **Loop Tiling**: This technique is useful for improving cache utilization by processing data in smaller blocks that fit into the cache, reducing memory access times.
// 
// 4. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the order of nested loops can sometimes improve data locality and access patterns, making it more suitable for parallel execution.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
// 
// Given the nature of the original code and its operations, the most relevant optimizations are loop fusion for the mean and standard deviation calculations and loop distribution for the correlation matrix calculation to isolate independent operations. Loop tiling and permutation might not be directly applicable without more context on the hardware specifics and memory access patterns.

        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            mean[j] += data[i][j];
            double temp = data[i][j] - mean[j] / float_n; // Temporarily hold the value for use in stddev calculation

        stddev[j] = (stddev[j] <= eps ? 1.0 : stddev[j]); // Adjust stddev
    }

    // Center and reduce the column vectors in one loop
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
        for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
            data[i][j] = (data[i][j] - mean[j]) / (sqrt(float_n) * stddev[j]);
        }
    }

    // Calculate the correlation matrix
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
        corr[i][i] = 1.0;
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
        for (j = i + 1; j < 80; j++) {
            corr[i][j] = 0.0;
            for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
                corr[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
            }
            corr[j][i] = corr[i][j];
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale
// 
// - **Loop Fusion**: By combining the initial mean and stddev calculations into a single loop, we reduce the number of passes over the data, improving cache utilization and reducing runtime.
// - **Loop Distribution**: The final correlation matrix calculation is kept separate to maintain clarity and because its optimization nature differs from the initial statistical calculations.
// - **Loop Permutation and Tiling**: Not applied due to lack of specific memory access pattern issues or hardware details. However, these could be considered based on the target architecture's memory hierarchy and parallel processing capabilities.
// 
// This transformed code aims to maintain the original functionality while improving performance through better data locality, reduced loop overhead, and enhanced opportunities for parallel execution in hardware.
