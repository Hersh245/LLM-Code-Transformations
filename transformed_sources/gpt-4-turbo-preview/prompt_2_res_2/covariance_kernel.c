// Given the performance estimates from the `merlin.rpt` file, it's clear that the most time-consuming part of the `kernel_covariance` function is within the nested loops starting at `loop i (cnn-krnl.cpp:44)`. The innermost loop (`loop k`) accounts for 91.5% of the accumulated cycles. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we'll focus on transformations that can impact this part of the code significantly, while also considering optimizations for other parts of the code based on the performance report.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_covariance(int m,int n,double float_n,double data[100][80],double cov[80][80],double mean[80])
{
  int i;
  int j;
  int k;

  // Original pragmas retained as requested
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  
  // Loop to calculate mean
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    mean[j] = 0.0;
    
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=mean FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      mean[j] += data[i][j];
    }
    mean[j] /= float_n;
  }
  
  // Loop to adjust data based on mean
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=data FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      data[i][j] -= mean[j];
    }
  }
  
  // Optimized covariance calculation
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L5}
    for (j = i; j < 80; j++) {
      cov[i][j] = 0.0;
      
      // Loop tiling transformation applied here
      int TILE_SIZE = 10; // Example tile size, adjust based on hardware constraints
      for (int kk = 0; kk < 100; kk += TILE_SIZE) {
        
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=cov FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
        for (k = kk; k < min(kk + TILE_SIZE, 100); k++) {
          cov[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
        }
      }
      
      cov[i][j] /= float_n - 1.0;
      if (i != j) {
        cov[j][i] = cov[i][j];
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling on the Covariance Calculation**: The innermost loop (`loop k`) is the most time-consuming part. Loop tiling (also known as loop blocking) can improve cache utilization and reduce memory access latency. By processing the data in smaller blocks, we can keep the working set of the data closer to the processor, potentially reducing the number of cache misses. This is particularly effective for nested loops that access large arrays.
// 
// 2. **Maintaining Original Pragmas**: The original pragmas for parallelization (`PARALLEL`), pipelining (`PIPELINE`), and tiling (`TILE`) are retained as they provide directives for the HLS tool to optimize the parallel execution and memory access patterns of the algorithm. Adjusting the `FACTOR=auto` allows the HLS tool to automatically determine the optimal factor based on the loop's characteristics and the target hardware constraints.
// 
// 3. **Conditional Update for Symmetric Elements in Covariance Matrix**: A small optimization is added to avoid redundant computation for the symmetric elements of the covariance matrix. This reduces the number of write operations to the `cov` array.
// 
// By applying these transformations, we aim to reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC) for the most time-consuming parts of the code, thus optimizing the overall performance of the `kernel_covariance` function for HLS.
