// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the code, we can observe that the majority of the execution time is spent within the nested loops (`loop_i` and `loop_j`). The inner loop (`loop_j`) is already pipelined but has a pipeline initiation interval (II) of 5, which indicates that a new iteration of the loop can start every 5 cycles. This is likely due to dependencies between iterations or resource limitations.
// 
// To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can consider the following transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Unrolling on `loop_j`:** This can potentially reduce the initiation interval by allowing parallel computation of multiple iterations of the loop. However, we need to be careful with resource usage as unrolling increases the demand for resources.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling on `loop_i`:** This can be beneficial if there's locality in the data access pattern that we can exploit, but given the nature of the code, it seems the accesses are already quite optimized, and tiling might not offer significant benefits.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion or Distribution:** There's only one significant loop nest here, so fusion doesn't apply. Distribution isn't directly applicable either since we don't have multiple distinct computations within the loop that could be separated to improve memory access patterns or parallelism.
// 
// Given these considerations, let's focus on unrolling `loop_j` to improve parallelism. We'll keep the original pragmas and add a pragma for loop unrolling.

// Rationale behind unrolling `loop_j`:
// - **Parallelism:** Unrolling the inner loop (`loop_j`) allows for more parallel computation of the force calculations, which can reduce the pipeline initiation interval (II) and thus increase throughput.
// - **Resource Utilization:** While unrolling increases resource usage (registers, arithmetic units, etc.), given the relatively small unroll factor (4) and the critical nature of this loop, the trade-off is likely favorable.
// - **Latency Reduction:** By computing multiple iterations of `loop_j` in parallel, we can reduce the overall latency of each iteration of `loop_i`, potentially leading to significant performance improvements.
// 
// Note: The effectiveness of these optimizations depends on the specifics of the target FPGA architecture and the HLS tool's ability to efficiently map the unrolled computations to hardware resources. It's always recommended to iteratively refine and test the design with actual synthesis and implementation tools to achieve the best performance.
