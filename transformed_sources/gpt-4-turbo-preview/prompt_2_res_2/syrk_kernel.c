// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the original code, it seems that the most time-consuming part is the nested loops, especially the loop over `k` and the innermost loop over `j` within it. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several loop transformations. The goal is to reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC), thereby improving the overall performance of the kernel.
// 
// ### Loop Fusion
// The first transformation we can consider is loop fusion. However, in this case, fusing loops might not directly apply because the operations inside the loops are quite different and depend on each other. Therefore, we'll skip loop fusion and consider other transformations.
// 
// ### Loop Tiling
// Loop tiling can be beneficial for improving data locality and potentially making better use of the cache. However, given the structure of the loops and the operations inside them, loop tiling might not offer significant benefits for this specific case, especially because the operations depend on the indices in a way that tiling might not easily optimize. 
// 
// ### Loop Permutation
// Loop permutation could be considered to optimize memory access patterns. However, the critical part of the computation is the multiplication and addition within the innermost loop, which depends on both `i` and `k` loops. Permuting `k` and `j` might not yield benefits due to the dependency on `i` and `j` for the condition `if (j <= i)`.
// 
// ### Loop Distribution
// Loop distribution involves splitting a loop into multiple loops over the same range but with different bodies. This can sometimes improve performance by separating independent computations. In this case, loop distribution might not be directly applicable because the operations inside the loops are closely related and depend on the results of previous iterations.
// 
// ### Optimized Code
// Given the constraints and the nature of the operations, the most straightforward optimization might not involve the transformations mentioned above but rather focusing on optimizing memory access and ensuring the pragmas are effectively utilized.
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60]) {
  int i, j, k;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
      C[i][j] *= beta;
    }

    for (k = 0; k < 60; k++) {
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
      for (j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale
// - **Maintaining Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been kept to ensure that the compiler's auto-optimization features are still utilized.
// - **Loop Restructuring**: The condition `if (j <= i)` has been moved outside to limit the range of `j` in both loops. This reduces the number of iterations where the condition needs to be checked and focuses computation on the necessary elements, potentially improving the cache utilization and reducing unnecessary computations.
// 
// This restructuring aims to maintain the original logic while potentially improving performance by reducing unnecessary checks and focusing on the elements of `C` that are actually modified. However, without specific details on how the compiler optimizes these pragmas and the architecture's specifics, the actual performance gains need to be verified through testing and further profiling.
