// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's an approach:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This technique can be applied to break down the loops into smaller chunks, improving cache locality and enabling more efficient use of on-chip memory.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can sometimes improve data locality and access patterns, enhancing the performance on hardware.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion**: Combining loops that iterate over the same range can reduce the overhead and improve data reuse.
// 
// 4. **Loop Distribution**: This can separate different computations within a loop into separate loops, which can be beneficial if different iterations of the loop can be parallelized differently.
// 
// Given the structure of the original code and its operations, the most beneficial transformations seem to be loop tiling for the `i` and `j` loops, and potentially loop permutation for better data access patterns. Loop fusion doesn't seem directly applicable because the operations within the loops are already quite optimized for their specific tasks. Loop distribution has been implicitly applied by separating the multiplication and addition operations into different loops.
// 
// Here's a transformed version of the code with explanations:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60]) {
  int i, j, k, ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 20; // Example tile size, can be tuned for specific hardware

#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  // Loop tiling for i and j loops
  for (ii = 0; ii < 80; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (jj = 0; jj < 80; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
      
      // Inner tiled loops
      for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 80; i++) {
        
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 80; j++) {
          if (j <= i) {
            C[i][j] *= beta;
          }
        }
      }
      
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
      
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
      
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
      for (k = 0; k < 60; k++) {
        
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
        for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 80; i++) {
          for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 80; j++) {
            if (j <= i) {
              C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// **Rationale**:
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to both `i` and `j` loops to improve data locality and enable better use of on-chip memory. This can also make it easier for the HLS tool to schedule operations and manage resources.
// - **Loop Permutation**: Not explicitly applied here, as the primary focus was on tiling, which inherently reorders loop execution to some extent. However, the restructuring due to tiling can also affect access patterns beneficially.
// - **Loop Fusion/Distribution**: The original code structure already has an effective separation of concerns, with multiplication and addition operations cleanly separated. Thus, we maintain this separation to keep the operations clear and allow for potential parallelization.
// 
// Remember, the effectiveness of these transformations can depend heavily on the specific hardware target and the HLS tool's capabilities. It's often beneficial to experiment with different strategies and tile sizes to find the optimal configuration for your specific situation.
