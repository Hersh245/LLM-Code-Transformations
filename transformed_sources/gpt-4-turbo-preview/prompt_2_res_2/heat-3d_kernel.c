// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the `kernel_heat_3d` function, we can consider several code transformations to optimize for High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The primary goals are to reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and improve the cycles per call (CPC), focusing on the loops since they account for the majority of the execution time.
// 
// ### Original Performance Bottlenecks:
// - The loops over `i`, `j`, and `k` within the `t` loop are the major contributors to the cycle count.
// - The `i` loops (both updates of `A` and `B`) are identical in terms of cycle count, suggesting that the operations within these loops are symmetric in terms of computation and memory access patterns.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations:
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: Combining the two separate loops that update `A` and `B` into a single loop can reduce the overhead of loop control and potentially improve data locality.
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: Applying loop tiling to the `i`, `j`, and `k` loops can improve cache utilization and reduce memory access latency. Given the auto-tiling pragmas already present, we ensure they are correctly placed to benefit from this transformation.
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order might help in improving memory access patterns, especially if it aligns better with the memory layout (e.g., row-major or column-major). However, due to dependencies in the computation, direct permutation might not be feasible without further analysis.
//

                    // Combined computation for both A and B updates
                    double tempB = 0.125 * (A[i + 1][j][k] - 2.0 * A[i][j][k] + A[i - 1][j][k])
                                 + 0.125 * (A[i][j + 1][k] - 2.0 * A[i][j][k] + A[i][j - 1][k])

                                 + A[i][j][k];
                    B[i][j][k] = tempB;
                    
                    // Update A immediately using the new value of B to enhance data locality
                    A[i][j][k] = 0.125 * (B[i + 1][j][k] - 2.0 * B[i][j][k] + B[i - 1][j][k])
                               + 0.125 * (B[i][j + 1][k] - 2.0 * B[i][j][k] + B[i][j - 1][k])
                               + 0.125 * (B[i][j][k + 1] - 2.0 * B[i][j][k] + B[i][j][k - 1])
                               + B[i][j][k];

}
// ### Rationale:
// - **Loop Fusion**: By combining the updates of `A` and `B` into a single loop iteration, we reduce the number of loop iterations and potentially improve the cache hit rate. This transformation was applied by computing `B[i][j][k]` and then immediately using it to compute `A[i][j][k]`.
// - **Loop Tiling and Pipeline Pragmas**: The existing pragmas for tiling and pipelining are retained and assumed to be automatically optimized by the HLS tool based on the `auto` keyword. These pragmas are crucial for exploiting parallelism and improving memory access patterns.
// - **Loop Permutation**: Not explicitly applied in the transformed code due to dependencies in the computation that might restrict the freedom to permute loops without a deeper analysis of potential data hazards.
// 
// This transformed code aims to maintain the computational integrity of the original code while optimizing for the hardware synthesis process. The effectiveness of these transformations would need to be verified with further HLS tool analysis and simulation.
