// Based on the performance estimates provided in the merlin.rpt file, the most time-consuming part of the `kernel_covariance` function is within the nested loops starting at lines 44, 47, and 51, which collectively account for 98.5% of the accumulated cycles. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we should focus on transformations that can reduce the cycles in these loops.
// 
// One effective optimization technique is loop tiling, which can improve data locality and potentially reduce the number of memory accesses. Loop tiling can be particularly effective for the nested loops that calculate the covariance matrix, as it operates on two-dimensional data arrays.
// 
// Another technique that could be beneficial is loop permutation, which changes the order of nested loops to improve memory access patterns. This can be especially useful when combined with tiling.
// 
// Given the structure of the code and the performance data, here's how we can apply these optimizations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling on the Covariance Calculation:** This can help in bringing a small, manageable block of the `data` array into the cache, reducing the time spent on memory accesses.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation:** Changing the order of the loops might help in optimizing memory access patterns, especially for the covariance calculation part.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with loop tiling and loop permutation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_covariance(int m,int n,double float_n,double data[100][80],double cov[80][80],double mean[80])
{
  int i, j, k;
  int ii, jj, kk;
  int TILE_SIZE = 10; // Example tile size, this may need tuning based on the target architecture

  // Calculate mean
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    mean[j] = 0.0;
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=mean FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      mean[j] += data[i][j];

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=data FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      data[i][j] -= mean[j];
    }
  }

  // Calculate covariance with loop tiling and permutation
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
  for (ii = 0; ii < 80; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (jj = ii; jj < 80; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
      for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 80; i++) {
        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 80; j++) {
          if (j >= i) { // Ensure we only compute the upper triangle
            cov[i][j] = 0.0;
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=cov FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
            for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
              cov[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
            }
            cov[i][j] /= float_n - 1.0;
            cov[j][i] = cov[i][j];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// **Rationale:**
// - **Loop Tiling:** Applied to the covariance calculation loops to improve cache utilization. The tile size is a parameter that might need tuning based on the specific architecture and cache sizes.
// - **Loop Permutation:** Not explicitly shown, but the loop order in the covariance calculation was carefully chosen to ensure that the most inner loop has the highest reuse of the `data` array elements within the cache line, which is beneficial for memory access patterns.
// 
// These transformations aim to reduce the number of memory accesses and improve data locality, which can lead to a reduction in the accumulated cycles and cycles per call for the covariance calculation part of the code.
