// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the code, we can observe that the majority of the execution time is spent within the nested loops (`loop_i` and `loop_j`). The inner loop (`loop_j`) is already pipelined with an initiation interval (II) of 5, indicating that a new iteration of the loop starts every 5 cycles. However, the outer loop (`loop_i`) is not explicitly optimized beyond the pipelining pragma. To improve performance, we can consider applying loop transformations that could potentially reduce the initiation interval, increase data locality, and make better use of available parallelism.
// 
// One potential optimization is loop tiling, which can enhance data locality and potentially allow for more efficient use of on-chip memory. However, given the nature of the computation (each iteration of `loop_i` is relatively independent and works on a small subset of the data), loop tiling might not be the most beneficial transformation here.
// 
// Loop fusion or loop distribution does not seem applicable here due to the structure of the code; there's only one significant loop nest.
// 
// Given this context, we can focus on optimizing data access patterns and exploring parallelism further. Since the code is already using pragmas to hint at parallelism and pipelining, we might consider increasing the parallelism factor if the hardware supports it. However, without specific details on the hardware constraints (e.g., the number of available processing elements), we'll assume a generic optimization approach focusing on data access.
// 
// Here's an optimized version of the code with an emphasis on improving data access patterns and ensuring that the compiler has more information to optimize parallelism. Note that without specific hardware details, these optimizations are heuristic-based:

      double j_x = position_x[jidx];

      double delz = i_z - j_z;
      double r2inv = 1.0 / (delx * delx + dely * dely + delz * delz);
      double r6inv = r2inv * r2inv * r2inv;
      double potential = r6inv * (1.5 * r6inv - 2.0);
      double force = r2inv * potential;
      
      fx[i] += delx * force;
      fy[i] += dely * force;
      fz[i] += delz * force;
    }
  }

  // Update forces after all neighbors accounted for.
  for (i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
    force_x[i] = fx[i];
    force_y[i] = fy[i];
    force_z[i] = fz[i];
  }
}
// Rationale behind the optimizations:
// - **Data Initialization**: Moved the force arrays (`fx`, `fy`, `fz`) initialization outside the loop and used them as temporary storage to reduce the dependency on the global arrays `force_x`, `force_y`, and `force_z`. This might help in reducing memory access latency.
// - **Loop Unchanged**: The core computation loop remains unchanged because the primary computation pattern does not lend itself easily to transformations like loop tiling without changing the algorithm's nature.
// - **Final Force Update**: A separate loop at the end updates the global force arrays. This separation ensures that the computation and memory update phases are distinct, potentially allowing the compiler to optimize memory accesses better.
// 
// These changes aim to provide hints to the HLS tool for better optimization, especially concerning memory access patterns and parallel execution. The effectiveness of these optimizations would ultimately depend on the specific HLS tool and the target hardware architecture.
