// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the code, we can consider several optimizations. The original code already includes pragmas for pipeline, tile, and parallelization, which are crucial for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) optimizations. However, there's still room for improvement by applying loop transformations. The goal is to reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC), and possibly improve data locality and parallelism.
// 
// ### Original Performance Bottlenecks:
// 
// - The outermost loop `t` has a high pipeline initiation interval (II) of 54, which indicates that it takes 54 cycles to launch each iteration of the loop. This is a significant bottleneck.
// - The nested loops over `i` and `j` are likely causing a lot of data movement, which isn't optimized beyond the automatic memory burst transfers.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling on `i` and `j` Loops**: This can improve cache locality and reduce the amount of data that needs to be fetched from the main memory. Given the size of the array `A`, a tile size that fits well into the cache should be considered.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Swapping the `i` and `j` loops might offer better spatial locality, depending on how the compiler is managing the array `A` in memory.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion/Distribution**: While not directly applicable in this simple nested loop scenario without additional computations, keeping an eye on opportunities to fuse loops that operate over the same index range or distribute loops that can be separated might be beneficial in more complex scenarios.
// 
// ### Transformed Code:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_seidel_2d(int tsteps, int n, double A[120][120]) {
  int t, i, j, ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 10; // Example tile size, needs tuning based on cache
  
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (t = 0; t <= 39; t++) {
    
    // Loop Tiling
    for (i = 1; i <= 118; i += TILE_SIZE) {
      for (j = 1; j <= 118; j += TILE_SIZE) {
        
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
        #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
        for (ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii <= 118; ii++) {
          for (jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE && jj <= 118; jj++) {
            
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
            A[ii][jj] = (A[ii - 1][jj - 1] + A[ii - 1][jj] + A[ii - 1][jj + 1] + A[ii][jj - 1] + A[ii][jj] + A[ii][jj + 1] + A[ii + 1][jj - 1] + A[ii + 1][jj] + A[ii + 1][jj + 1]) / 9.0;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale:
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to `i` and `j` loops to improve data locality. This should reduce the number of memory accesses required and potentially lower the AC and CPC.
// - **Loop Permutation**: Not applied in this case as the access pattern to `A` is symmetrical with respect to `i` and `j`. However, in cases where memory access patterns are not symmetrical, loop permutation could be beneficial.
// - The original pragmas are kept and applied to the innermost loops to ensure that the compiler still attempts to optimize parallelism and pipeline stages within the newly tiled loops.
// 
// ### Note:
// 
// - The `TILE_SIZE` is set to 10 as an example. This parameter should be tuned based on the actual cache size and architecture to find the optimal value for performance.
// - Further optimizations might include exploring different tile sizes or applying more advanced techniques like loop unrolling for the innermost loops, depending on the specific capabilities and limitations of the target hardware architecture.
