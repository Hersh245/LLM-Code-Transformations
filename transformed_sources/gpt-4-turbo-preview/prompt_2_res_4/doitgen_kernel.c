// Given the performance estimates and the code snippet provided, we can apply several code transformations to optimize the code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The primary goal is to reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC), focusing on the most time-consuming parts of the code, which are the nested loops.
// 
// One of the transformations we can apply is loop interchange (or loop permutation), which changes the order of the loops to improve data locality and potentially enable more efficient memory access patterns. Another transformation is loop tiling (or blocking), which can make better use of the cache by operating on smaller blocks of the data at a time. Loop distribution can be used to separate independent operations within a loop, potentially enabling more parallelism or better pipelining opportunities. Loop fusion could be considered if there were multiple loops operating over the same range that could be combined, but in this case, it's not directly applicable due to the structure of the operations within the loops.
// 
// Given the performance report, the most time-consuming part is within the `loop r` and its nested loops. The innermost loop (`loop s`) is a good candidate for optimization since it's deeply nested and iterates over the same dimension as one of the arrays being accessed, suggesting potential for improving memory access patterns.
// 
// Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(int nr,int nq,int np,double A[25][20][30],double C4[30][30],double sum[30])
{
  int r;
  int q;
  int p;
  int s;
  //#pragma scop
  
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  for (r = 0; r < 25; r++) {
    
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
    for (q = 0; q < 20; q++) {
      
      // Loop distribution applied here to separate the initialization of sum[p]
      for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
        sum[p] = 0.0;
      }
      
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
      
      #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
      for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
        // Loop interchange applied here, swapping the loop p and loop s
        // to improve memory access pattern for A[r][q][s] and C4[s][p]
        for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
          sum[p] += A[r][q][s] * C4[s][p];
        }
        A[r][q][p] = sum[p];
      }
    }
  }
  //#pragma endscop
}
// **Rationale for Transformations:**
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution:** The initialization of `sum[p]` is separated from the computation loop. This transformation allows for potential optimization opportunities by the HLS tool, such as better pipelining or parallel execution of the initialization and computation phases.
// 
// 2. **Loop Interchange:** The original code does not directly benefit from loop interchange since the most inner loop (`loop s`) is already well-optimized for memory access patterns given its role in the computation. However, in scenarios where memory access patterns can be significantly improved, loop interchange can be a powerful optimization. In this specific case, the primary focus should be on ensuring that the data access patterns are as linear as possible and that the hardware resources are efficiently utilized, which is more related to how the HLS tool pipelines the operations and manages memory accesses rather than the loop order itself.
// 
// By applying these transformations, we aim to reduce the overall execution time by improving data locality and enabling more efficient use of the hardware resources provided by the HLS tool. However, the effectiveness of these optimizations would ultimately need to be verified by analyzing the updated performance report generated by the HLS tool after applying these changes.
