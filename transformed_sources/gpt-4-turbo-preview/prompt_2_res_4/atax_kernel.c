// Based on the performance estimate provided, the most time-consuming part of the code is within the second loop `i` (92.4% of the total cycles), especially the first inner loop `j` (74.9%). To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations aimed at reducing the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC), and improving data locality and parallelism.
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: The two inner `j` loops can be merged into a single loop to improve data locality and reduce the overhead of loop control. This should reduce the total number of iterations and potentially improve the cache usage.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: Although not directly suggested by the performance report, loop tiling can be beneficial for improving cache utilization and enabling more efficient parallel execution. However, the original code does not seem to be a perfect candidate for tiling due to its structure. We will focus on other optimizations.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Swapping the loops might not be directly applicable due to the data dependencies in the algorithm.
// 
// 4. **Loop Unrolling**: This is implicitly suggested through the `ACCEL PARALLEL` pragma with `FACTOR=auto`. Explicit loop unrolling might not be necessary as the pragma should handle it.
// 
// Given the structure of the original code and the performance report, the most straightforward and impactful optimization seems to be loop fusion. Here's how the optimized code might look:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m,int n,double A[116][124],double x[124],double y[124],double tmp[116])
{
  int i, j;
  // Initialize y to 0
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) 
    y[i] = ((double )0);
  
  // Combined operations within a single loop iteration to improve data locality
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    tmp[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      // Fused operation: Compute tmp and update y in the same iteration
      tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
      y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
    }
  }
}
// **Rationale**:
// - **Loop Fusion**: By combining the operations on `tmp[i]` and `y[j]` within the same loop iteration, we reduce the overhead of iterating through the loops separately and improve data locality. This should help in reducing the cycles per call (CPC) for the inner loop operations.
// - **Preserved Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been kept to ensure that the compiler's directives for parallelism and optimization hints (like pipelining and tiling) are preserved. These pragmas are crucial for guiding the HLS tool in optimizing the hardware implementation.
// 
// This transformation focuses on reducing the overhead and improving the efficiency of the innermost computations, which are the most time-consuming parts of the original code. It's important to note that actual performance improvements would need to be verified through HLS synthesis and simulation, as the effectiveness of optimizations can vary based on the specific hardware target and the HLS tool's capabilities.
