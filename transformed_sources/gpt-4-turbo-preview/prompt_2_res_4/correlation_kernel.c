// Based on the performance estimate provided, the most time-consuming part of the code is the nested loop structure starting at `loop i (cnn-krnl.cpp:68)`, which accounts for 96.5% of the accumulated cycles. This suggests that optimizing this part of the code could lead to significant performance improvements. The innermost loop (`loop k`) has a pipeline initiation interval (II) of 5, indicating that there is room for optimization, possibly by improving data locality or reducing loop overhead.

        for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
          corr[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];

// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: The original code calculates the correlation matrix in a triangular manner, which can lead to non-uniform memory access patterns and inefficient use of the pipeline. By transforming the loop to calculate the entire matrix directly, we ensure that all elements of `corr` are computed in a single, cohesive loop structure. This can improve data locality and reduce the overhead associated with managing nested loops.
// 
// 2. **Removal of Conditional Inside Loop**: The condition to set diagonal elements of `corr` to 1.0 after the main computation loop has been integrated into the main loop itself. This reduces the need for a separate conditional check for every iteration of the innermost loop, thus streamlining the execution path.
// 
// 3. **Maintaining Original Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been kept in place to ensure that the compiler's directives for parallelization, pipelining, and tiling are preserved. These pragmas are crucial for instructing the compiler on how to optimize the code for parallel execution and efficient memory access patterns.
// 
// ### Rationale:
// 
// The primary focus of these optimizations is to address the performance bottleneck identified in the original code, specifically within the correlation matrix calculation. By restructuring the loop and integrating conditional logic directly into the computation, we aim to enhance the efficiency of memory access and reduce the overhead associated with loop control and conditional branching. These changes are expected to significantly reduce the accumulated cycles and improve the overall performance of the kernel.
