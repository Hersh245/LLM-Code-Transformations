// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the code, we can apply several optimizations to improve the performance for High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The primary focus will be on loop transformations that can enhance data locality and parallelism, which are crucial for achieving higher performance in HLS.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// - The outermost loop `t` has a trip count (TC) of 40, which is fixed.
// - The inner loops `i`, `j`, and `k` iterate over a 3D array with dimensions 18x18x18 (considering the loop bounds start from 1 and end at 18), which are the primary contributors to the accumulated cycles (AC).
// - The performance report indicates that the loops `i` in both the computation blocks have a significant impact on the performance, each contributing to approximately 49.6% of the accumulated cycles.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation can enhance data locality by processing smaller blocks of the 3D array at a time. It can be particularly beneficial for the loops `i`, `j`, and `k` as they iterate over a 3D array.
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: Combining the two separate loops that iterate over `i`, `j`, and `k` can reduce the overhead of loop indexing and potentially increase the efficiency of memory access patterns.
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can sometimes improve data locality. However, due to the nature of the computation (which accesses neighboring elements in all dimensions), the best loop order might already be in use.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
// Given the analysis, the primary focus will be on applying loop tiling. Loop fusion seems less applicable due to the dependency between the two computation blocks (the output of the first block is the input to the second). Loop permutation might not yield significant benefits due to the balanced access pattern in all dimensions.

// ### Rationale
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to `i`, `j`, and `k` loops to improve cache locality by processing the data in smaller blocks. This can significantly reduce cache misses and improve performance.
// - The `TILE_SIZE` is a parameter that can be tuned based on the specific architecture and cache sizes. The choice of 4 is arbitrary and should be optimized based on experimentation.
// - The `min` function ensures that the tile does not exceed the bounds of the array.
// - All original pragmas have been kept in place to ensure that the compiler's HLS directives for parallelism and pipelining are respected.
// 
// This transformation is expected to improve the performance by reducing the number of cache misses and making better use of the memory hierarchy. However, the optimal `TILE_SIZE` and the impact of these transformations would need to be evaluated experimentally.
