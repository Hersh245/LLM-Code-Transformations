// Based on the performance estimate provided, the most time-consuming parts of the code are the nested loops within the `t` loop, each contributing significantly to the total accumulated cycles (AC). To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: Combining loops that iterate over the same range can reduce the overhead of loop control and potentially increase data locality. However, in this case, due to data dependencies between the loops, loop fusion may not be directly applicable without violating data dependencies.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique can enhance data locality and parallelism. Given the large size of the data arrays and the nested loops iterating over them, loop tiling could be beneficial, especially for the loops iterating over `i` and `j`. However, the pragma directives already suggest automatic tiling, so manual tiling might not yield significant improvements unless we find a specific tile size that outperforms the automatic choice.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the order of nested loops can improve data locality and cache usage. However, the current loop order seems to be optimal in terms of memory access patterns for arrays `ex`, `ey`, and `hz`.
// 
// Given these considerations and the constraints mentioned, a direct application of these transformations might not be straightforward without additional information on data dependencies and memory access patterns. However, we can attempt to apply loop tiling manually to the `i` and `j` loops to see if we can outperform the automatic settings, and carefully evaluate if any loop fusion is possible without breaking data dependencies.
// 
// Below is an example of how one might attempt to manually tile one of the loops, keeping in mind that the effectiveness of this transformation heavily depends on the specific architecture and memory hierarchy of the target FPGA:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax,int nx,int ny,double ex[60][80],double ey[60][80],double hz[60][80],double _fict_[40]) {
  int t, i, j, ii, jj;
  int TILE_SIZE_I = 10; // Example tile size for i dimension
  int TILE_SIZE_J = 16; // Example tile size for j dimension

  //#pragma scop

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}

  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
    
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];
    }
    
    // Manually tiled loops for ey update
    for (ii = 1; ii < 60; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
      for (jj = 0; jj < 80; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
        for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_I && i < 60; i++) {
          for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < 80; j++) {
            ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // Similar tiling can be applied to other loops if beneficial
    // Note: The actual implementation should consider data dependencies and may require adjustments

  }
  //#pragma endscop
}
// This example only demonstrates manual tiling for one of the loops. The effectiveness of such transformations should be validated by profiling and comparing the performance before and after the changes. Additionally, the choice of `TILE_SIZE_I` and `TILE_SIZE_J` should be based on the specific characteristics of the target FPGA, such as its memory hierarchy and parallel processing capabilities.
