// Based on the performance estimate provided, the majority of the execution time is spent within the nested loops, particularly within the `loop k` and its nested `loop j`. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations aimed at reducing the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC), while also considering the trip count (TC) impact. The transformations include loop tiling, loop permutation, and loop distribution. These transformations are chosen based on their potential to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60]) {
  int i, j, k, jj, kk;
  const int TILE_SIZE_J = 20; // Tile size for j loop
  const int TILE_SIZE_K = 15; // Tile size for k loop

  // Loop tiling for j and k loops to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of the cache
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}

  // Loop permutation to interchange the j and k loops for better memory access pattern
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    for (jj = 0; jj < 80; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {
      for (kk = 0; kk < 60; kk += TILE_SIZE_K) {

        // Loop distribution to separate the multiplication and accumulation operations
        // This allows for better pipelining and parallel execution
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
        for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_SIZE_J) < 80 ? (jj + TILE_SIZE_J) : 80); j++) {
          if (j <= i) {
            C[i][j] *= beta;
          }
        }

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
        for (k = kk; k < ((kk + TILE_SIZE_K) < 60 ? (kk + TILE_SIZE_K) : 60); k++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
          for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_SIZE_J) < 80 ? (jj + TILE_SIZE_J) : 80); j++) {
            if (j <= i) {
              C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to both the `j` and `k` loops to enhance data locality. By processing data in smaller blocks (tiles), we can make more efficient use of the cache, reducing the time spent on memory accesses. The tile sizes are chosen based on typical cache sizes and should be tuned for the specific hardware target.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: The original code has the `k` loop inside the `j` loop. By permuting these loops, we aim to improve the memory access pattern, especially for accessing elements of array `A`. This can lead to better utilization of spatial locality, as consecutive iterations of the innermost loop access consecutive memory locations.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: The original code performs multiplication and accumulation within the same loop nest. By distributing these operations into separate loop nests, we can potentially increase the opportunity for parallel execution and improve the efficiency of pipelining. This separation allows the compiler to better optimize each operation.
// 
// 4. **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been preserved and strategically placed to ensure that the compiler's HLS directives for parallelism, pipelining, and tiling are effectively applied to the transformed code structure.
// 
// These transformations are designed to work together to reduce the overall execution time by improving parallelism, enhancing data locality, and making more efficient use of hardware resources during High-Level Synthesis.
