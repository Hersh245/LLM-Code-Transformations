// Given the performance estimate and the original code, it's clear that the inner loop (loop j) inside the second loop i is the most time-consuming part of the computation, consuming approximately 89.7% of the total cycles. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg_optimized(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124]) {
  int i, j;
  
  // Initialize s[] and q[] arrays
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    s[i] = ((double)0);
  }
  
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
    q[i] = 0.0;
  }
  
  // Loop distribution applied to separate the accumulation operations
  // This allows for better memory access patterns and potential parallelization
  
  // Accumulate into s[]
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
      s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
    }
  }
  
  // Accumulate into q[]
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
      q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: The original code performs two distinct accumulations within a single nested loop. By distributing the loops, we separate these accumulations, which can improve memory access patterns and allow for more effective use of parallelism. This transformation is particularly beneficial when dealing with different data dependencies in the accumulations.
// 
// 2. **Maintaining Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been maintained and appropriately placed to ensure that the compiler can still apply parallelization, pipelining, and tiling optimizations where possible. The pragmas are crucial for directing the HLS tool on how to optimize the loops for parallel execution and memory access.
// 
// 3. **Parallelism and Pipelining**: By keeping the `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` and `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directives, we encourage the HLS tool to explore parallel execution within the loops and pipeline operations to speed up the execution. The `FACTOR=auto` allows the HLS tool to automatically determine the best factor for parallelism and pipelining based on the target hardware constraints.
// 
// 4. **Separate Initialization Loops**: The initialization of `s[]` and `q[]` arrays has been kept separate and before the main computation loops. This ensures that all necessary data is ready before the computation begins, and it may help in reducing dependencies and improving the scheduling of operations.
// 
// By applying these transformations, we aim to reduce the overall accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC) for the `kernel_bicg` function, making it more efficient for HLS targets. The exact performance gains would need to be verified by running the transformed code through the HLS tool and reviewing the new performance estimates.
