// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, reduce memory access latency, and enhance data reuse. We'll focus on loop tiling, loop permutation, and loop distribution as these are most relevant to the given code. Here's how the transformed code might look:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m, int n, double A[116][124], double x[124], double y[124], double tmp[116]) {
  int i, j, ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE_I = 58; // Example tile size, can be tuned for specific architectures
  const int TILE_SIZE_J = 62; // Example tile size, can be tuned for specific architectures

  // Initialize y to 0
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++)
    y[i] = ((double)0);

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

  // Loop tiling for tmp computation and y update
  for (ii = 0; ii < 116; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
    int I_MAX = (ii + TILE_SIZE_I > 116) ? 116 : ii + TILE_SIZE_I;

    for (jj = 0; jj < 124; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {
      int J_MAX = (jj + TILE_SIZE_J > 124) ? 124 : jj + TILE_SIZE_J;

      // Compute tmp within tile
      for (i = ii; i < I_MAX; i++) {
        if (jj == 0) tmp[i] = 0.0; // Initialize tmp for each new row tile

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
        for (j = jj; j < J_MAX; j++) {
          tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
      }

      // Update y within tile
      for (i = ii; i < I_MAX; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
        for (j = jj; j < J_MAX; j++) {
          y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is applied to both the computation of `tmp` and the update of `y`. It helps in improving data locality by working on smaller, contiguous blocks of the arrays `A`, `tmp`, and `y`. This can reduce the number of memory accesses and potentially fit the working set into faster cache memory. The choice of tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I` and `TILE_SIZE_J`) is crucial and should be tuned based on the target architecture's cache sizes and memory bandwidth.
// 
// 2. **Loop Fusion/Distribution**: Initially, it might seem we are distributing the loops over `tmp` and `y` updates. However, by integrating these within the same tiled loops, we maintain data locality benefits for both `tmp` and `y`. This approach ensures that once a tile of `tmp` is computed, it is immediately used to update `y`, maximizing cache utilization.
// 
// 3. **Parallel Pragmas**: The use of `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` with reduction for both `tmp` and `y` updates is maintained to hint at parallel execution where possible. The `FACTOR=auto` allows the HLS tool to automatically determine the best unrolling factor based on the target architecture.
// 
// 4. **Loop Permutation**: While not explicitly shown as a transformation, the choice of loop order (first iterating over tiles, then within tiles) is crucial for achieving the intended benefits of loop tiling.
// 
// ### Final Notes:
// The effectiveness of these optimizations heavily depends on the target hardware architecture, especially its memory hierarchy and parallel execution capabilities. Further tuning, such as adjusting tile sizes or exploring additional transformations like loop unrolling, might be necessary to achieve optimal performance.
