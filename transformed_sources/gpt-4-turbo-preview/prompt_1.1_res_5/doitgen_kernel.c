// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(int nr, int nq, int np, double A[25][20][30], double C4[30][30], double sum[30]) {
  int r;
  int q;
  int p;
  int s;
  //#pragma scop

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
  // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // The TILE FACTOR values should be chosen based on the target FPGA's resources and the specific requirements of the application.
  // For demonstration, let's assume TILE FACTORs of 10 for 'r' and 'q' loops, and 15 for the 'p' loop.
  // These values are hypothetical and should be tuned for the actual hardware and problem size.
  #define TILE_R 5
  #define TILE_Q 10
  #define TILE_P 15
  
  for (r = 0; r < 25; r += TILE_R) {
    for (q = 0; q < 20; q += TILE_Q) {
      
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
      
      for (int tr = r; tr < r + TILE_R && tr < 25; ++tr) {
        for (int tq = q; tq < q + TILE_Q && tq < 20; ++tq) {
          
          // Loop distribution is applied here to separate the initialization of 'sum' array from the computation loop.
          // This helps in pipelining the computation loop more efficiently.
          for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
            sum[p] = 0.0;
          }
          
          #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
          
          for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
            for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
              sum[p] += A[tr][tq][s] * C4[s][p];
            }
            A[tr][tq][p] = sum[p];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  //#pragma endscop
}
// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** Applied to the 'r', 'q', and 'p' loops to improve cache locality and reduce memory access latency. This transformation divides the loops into smaller chunks (tiles), which can be more efficiently loaded into on-chip memory, reducing the time spent accessing off-chip memory. The tile sizes (`TILE_R`, `TILE_Q`, `TILE_P`) are chosen based on the hardware's memory hierarchy and the size of the data structures to balance between maximizing data reuse and fitting within on-chip memory constraints.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution:** Separates the initialization of the `sum` array from the computation loop. This allows the initialization to be fully pipelined separately from the computation, potentially increasing the overall throughput of the kernel by reducing dependencies between different parts of the loop body.
// 
// 3. **Pipelining:** The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directives are kept to instruct the HLS tool to attempt to pipeline the loops, aiming for executing different iterations of the loop in parallel. This is crucial for achieving high throughput, especially in the innermost loops where the bulk of the computation occurs.
// 
// 4. **Loop Permutation:** Not explicitly applied here, but loop tiling inherently changes the execution order of loop iterations, which can be seen as a form of loop permutation. This is beneficial for accessing memory in a more predictable pattern, which can improve memory access efficiency on many architectures.
// 
// It's important to note that the effectiveness of these transformations can vary significantly depending on the specific hardware target and the characteristics of the workload. Therefore, iterative profiling and tuning are essential to achieve optimal performance.
