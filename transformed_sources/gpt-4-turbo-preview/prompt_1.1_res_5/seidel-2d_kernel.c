// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we need to consider the goal of each transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This is changing the order of nested loops, which can be beneficial for improving data locality and possibly making other optimizations more apparent or applicable.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This involves breaking a loop into blocks or tiles. It can improve cache utilization and enable more parallel execution.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This separates a loop into multiple loops over the same range but with different bodies, which can help in reducing dependencies and enabling parallelism.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: This combines two adjacent loops that have the same loop bounds into a single loop, which can reduce loop overhead and improve data locality.
// 
// Given the nature of the code, which involves updating a 2D grid based on the values of neighboring cells, loop tiling seems to be a particularly relevant optimization. It can help in ensuring that the data worked on fits into the cache, reducing memory access times. Loop permutation might also be considered to optimize memory access patterns, but in this case, the access pattern is already pretty optimal for standard row-major array storage. Loop fusion and distribution don't seem immediately applicable without further context on what can be computed in parallel or how the computation might be decomposed.
// 
// Here's an example of applying loop tiling to the provided code. Note that the choice of tile size (`TILE_SIZE`) can significantly affect performance and should be tuned based on the specific hardware and its cache hierarchy.

// In this transformed code, the inner two loops over `i` and `j` are tiled. This means that instead of updating the entire array row by row, the array is updated in smaller blocks of size `TILE_SIZE x TILE_SIZE`. This can help to keep the working set of data (the data being actively used and updated) small enough to fit into a faster level of the memory hierarchy, reducing the time spent on memory accesses.
// 
// Remember, the specific optimizations and their effectiveness can vary greatly depending on the target hardware and the specific problem being solved. Thus, experimentation and profiling are key to finding the best set of optimizations.
