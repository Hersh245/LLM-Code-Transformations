// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance in hardware implementations. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax, int nx, int ny, double ex[60][80], double ey[60][80], double hz[60][80], double _fict_[40]) {
  int t, i, j;

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
  for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
    // Loop fusion for ey update and ex update to improve data locality
    // and reduce the number of loop iterations.
    for (i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
      for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
        // Update ey for the first row using _fict_ array
        if (i == 0) {
          ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];
        } else {
          // Update ey for other rows
          ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);
        }
        
        // Update ex, skipping the first column to avoid out-of-bounds access
        if (j > 0) {
          ex[i][j] = ex[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]);
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Separate loop for hz update to maintain correct data dependencies
    // and to avoid RAW (Read After Write) hazards.
    for (i = 0; i < 59; i++) {
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
      for (j = 0; j < 79; j++) {
        hz[i][j] = hz[i][j] - 0.7 * (ex[i][j + 1] - ex[i][j] + ey[i + 1][j] - ey[i][j]);
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: The original code updates `ey` and `ex` arrays in separate loops. By fusing these loops, we can reduce the number of loop iterations and improve data locality, as the data loaded into cache for updating `ey` can be reused immediately for updating `ex`. This is especially beneficial for FPGAs where memory bandwidth and data locality are critical for performance. However, we maintain a separate loop for updating `hz` to preserve the correct execution order and data dependencies.
// 
// 2. **Parallelism**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directives hint at the compiler to exploit parallelism within the loops. By maintaining these pragmas and adjusting the loop structure, we ensure that the compiler has the necessary information to parallelize the computations effectively.
// 
// 3. **Pipeline Efficiency**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directive is kept at the top of the time loop (`t` loop) to ensure that different iterations of this loop can be executed in an overlapped manner, improving the pipeline efficiency. This is crucial for achieving high throughput in hardware implementations.
// 
// 4. **Data Dependency and Hazards**: The separation of the `hz` update loop from the fused `ey` and `ex` update loop is necessary to maintain the correct data dependencies and avoid read-after-write (RAW) hazards. This ensures that the updates to `hz` are based on the fully updated `ey` and `ex` arrays from the same timestep, preserving the correctness of the algorithm.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is optimized for HLS, taking advantage of parallelism, improving data locality, and ensuring efficient pipeline execution, which are key for achieving high performance on FPGAs and similar hardware accelerators.
