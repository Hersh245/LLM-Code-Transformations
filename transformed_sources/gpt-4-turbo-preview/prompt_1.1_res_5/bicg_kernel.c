// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The primary goals of these transformations are to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency, which can significantly enhance performance on hardware accelerators. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124]) {
    int i, j;
    double temp_s[116] = {0.0}; // Temporary array for s to improve data locality and enable parallel reductions

    // Initialize q to zero
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        q[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // Loop tiling for improved data locality and better use of on-chip memory
    // Assuming TILE_SIZE is a divisor of both 124 and 116 for simplicity
    #define TILE_SIZE 8
    for (int ii = 0; ii < 124; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (int jj = 0; jj < 116; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
            // Loop permutation to access A in row-major order for better spatial locality
            #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
            for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE; i++) {
                double q_temp = 0.0; // Temporary variable for q to enable parallel reduction
                for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE; j++) {
                    temp_s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
                    q_temp += A[i][j] * p[j];
                }
                q[i] += q_temp; // Accumulate the result back to q
            }
        }
    }

    // Reduction to accumulate values in temp_s back to s with parallelism
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
        s[j] = temp_s[j];
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Temporary Array for `s`**: Introducing a temporary array `temp_s` for accumulating the results before writing them back to `s` at the end. This transformation is crucial for enabling parallel reduction without causing race conditions.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: The code has been restructured with loop tiling (also known as loop blocking) for both the `i` and `j` loops. This transformation improves data locality by working on smaller sub-matrices of `A`, `s`, and `q` that fit into the faster, on-chip memory, reducing memory access times and improving cache efficiency.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Inside the tiled loops, the order of accessing array `A` has been changed to access it in a row-major order. This change enhances spatial locality since consecutive iterations access contiguous memory locations, which is more efficient on many architectures.
// 
// 4. **Parallel Reduction for `q` and `s`**: The use of a temporary variable `q_temp` within the inner loop and a temporary array `temp_s` enables parallel reduction. This approach allows multiple iterations to execute in parallel without interfering with each other's results, which is then accumulated safely to the original `q` and `s` arrays.
// 
// 5. **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been preserved and are assumed to be correctly guiding the HLS tool for parallelism, pipelining, and tiling optimizations. Adjustments to these pragmas might be necessary based on the specific HLS tool and target hardware characteristics.
// 
// 6. **Removal of Initial Zeroing Loop for `s`**: The initial loop that zeroes out `s` has been removed because `temp_s` is initialized to zero and its final values are copied back to `s` at the end, making the initial zeroing redundant.
// 
// These transformations collectively aim to enhance the performance of the kernel on hardware accelerators by improving parallelism, reducing memory access latencies, and ensuring efficient use of on-chip memory resources.
