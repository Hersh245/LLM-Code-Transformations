// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This is useful when accessing multi-dimensional arrays to ensure that memory accesses are as contiguous as possible.
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique breaks down loops into smaller chunks or "tiles", improving cache utilization and enabling more parallel execution.
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This can separate different computations in a loop to allow for more optimization opportunities like parallelism.
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: This combines two separate loops that have the same loop bounds into a single loop, reducing the overhead of loop control and improving data locality.
// 
// Given the nature of the code, we'll focus on loop permutation and loop tiling, as these seem the most applicable. Loop fusion and distribution don't have clear applications without further changing the algorithm's structure.

      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=cov FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
      for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
        cov[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];

// ### Rationale:
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to all major loops to improve data locality and cache usage. The factor of 16 is arbitrary and should be tuned based on the target architecture's cache size and memory bandwidth.
// - **Parallel Pragmas**: Retained and applied where data dependencies allow, to hint at the compiler/HLS tool for potential parallel execution.
// - **Pipeline Pragmas**: Used to suggest that loops can be executed in a pipelined fashion, improving throughput.
// 
// ### Note:
// - The effectiveness of these optimizations heavily depends on the target hardware and the HLS tool's ability to interpret and apply these pragmas.
// - Further profiling and tuning would be necessary to find the optimal tile sizes and parallelization factors for a specific hardware target.
