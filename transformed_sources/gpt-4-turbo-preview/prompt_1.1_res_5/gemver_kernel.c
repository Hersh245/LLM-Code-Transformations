// To optimize the provided C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance in hardware. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gemver(int n, double alpha, double beta, double A[120][120], double u1[120], double v1[120], double u2[120], double v2[120], double w[120], double x[120], double y[120], double z[120])
{
  int i, j;

#pragma scop

  // Loop tiling for the first loop nest to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // Tiling factor is chosen based on the typical size of on-chip memory and the data size of A, u1, v1, u2, and v2.
  int TILE_SIZE = 30; // Example tile size, this should be tuned based on the target architecture.
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
      for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 120; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=A FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 120; j++) {
          A[i][j] += u1[i] * v1[j] + u2[i] * v2[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Loop fusion for the second and third loop nests to reduce the number of passes over the data.
  // This transformation can improve data locality and reduce memory access overhead.
  // Note: This transformation assumes that dependencies between loop iterations allow for fusion.
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
  for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=x FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L5}
    for (j = 0; j < 120; j++) {
      x[i] += beta * A[j][i] * y[j];
    }
    x[i] += z[i]; // Merged from the third loop nest.
  }

  // The fourth loop nest remains unchanged as it already benefits from parallelism and pipeline optimizations.
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L3}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L3}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
  for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=w FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
    for (j = 0; j < 120; j++) {
      w[i] += alpha * A[i][j] * x[j];
    }
  }

#pragma endscop
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the first loop nest to improve data locality and cache utilization. By working on smaller sub-matrices, we can ensure that the data stays closer to the computation units, reducing memory access times. This is particularly beneficial for hardware accelerators that have limited but fast on-chip memory.
// 
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: Combining the second and third loop nests helps in reducing the overall memory access overhead. By updating `x[i]` in a single pass, we minimize the number of reads and writes to the `x` array, which can be a significant performance bottleneck in memory-bound applications.
// 
// 3. **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas are preserved to ensure that the compiler's ability to automatically optimize parallelism, pipelining, and tiling based on the target architecture is not hindered. These pragmas provide hints to the HLS tool for potential optimizations, and their parameters (e.g., `FACTOR=auto`) allow the tool to adjust the optimization strategies based on the specific hardware constraints.
// 
// These transformations aim to strike a balance between computational efficiency and memory access patterns, which is crucial for achieving high performance in hardware implementations. However, the effectiveness of these transformations can vary based on the target architecture and the specific characteristics of the HLS tool used. Therefore, further tuning and experimentation may be necessary to achieve optimal performance.
