// Optimizing the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) involves applying code transformations that enhance parallelism and data locality, and reduce latency. The transformations I'll apply are:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This technique improves data locality by processing data in smaller blocks that fit into faster, closer memory (like cache in CPUs or local memory in FPGAs). It's especially effective for nested loops that access multi-dimensional arrays.
// 
// 2. **Loop Unrolling**: This increases parallelism by executing multiple iterations of a loop simultaneously. It's beneficial for loops with independent iterations.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can sometimes improve data locality and enable other optimizations like vectorization.
// 
// Given the structure of the original code and the presence of dependencies within the loops, we have to be careful with transformations to ensure correctness. The original code already hints at parallelism and pipelining optimizations with `#pragma ACCEL` directives. Let's focus on loop tiling and loop unrolling, as they are most relevant for HLS.

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to both the column and row sweep phases, breaking the iterations into smaller chunks to potentially improve data locality and enable finer-grained parallelism.
// - **Loop Unrolling**: Not explicitly shown, but the `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto` directive hints at the compiler to automatically unroll loops where beneficial, increasing parallel execution.
// - **Loop Permutation**: Not applied here as the original loop order seems optimal for accessing array elements sequentially in memory, which is important for performance.
// 
// These transformations aim to make the code more amenable to parallel execution and efficient memory access patterns, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators.
