// Based on the performance estimate provided, the most time-consuming parts of the code are the loops over `t`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, with the loops over `i` being the most significant contributors to the accumulated cycles. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several loop transformations. Here, we'll focus on loop tiling and loop interchange, as these transformations can significantly impact performance by improving data locality and enabling more efficient use of on-chip memory.
// 
// ### Loop Tiling
// 
// Loop tiling, also known as loop blocking, can improve cache performance by accessing blocks of data that fit into the cache, reducing the number of cache misses. This is particularly useful for nested loops working on large data arrays.
// 
// ### Loop Interchange
// 
// Loop interchange alters the nesting order of loops to improve memory access patterns, potentially enhancing spatial locality and reducing cache misses.
// 
// Given the structure of the loops and the operations performed within the innermost loop, loop interchange and loop tiling seem to be the most promising optimizations. However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of these optimizations can depend on the specific architecture and the size of the data being processed.
// 
// Here is the transformed code with loop tiling and loop interchange applied:

// In this transformation, we've introduced loop tiling for the `i`, `j`, and `k` loops with a `TILE_SIZE` that may need to be tuned based on the specific target architecture and memory hierarchy. This tiling aims to improve data locality and cache usage. The original pragmas have been preserved to ensure that the compiler's high-level synthesis optimizations are still applied.
// 
// It's important to profile the transformed code to ensure that these optimizations have the desired effect on performance, as the optimal transformations can vary depending on the specifics of the hardware and the size of the data.
