// Based on the performance estimates provided in the `merlin.rpt` file, we can observe that the majority of the execution time is spent within the loops iterating over `t`, `i`, and `j`. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several loop transformations. The transformations will focus on improving data locality, reducing loop overhead, and enhancing parallelism, which are crucial for achieving better performance on hardware.
// 
// Given the structure of the loops and the operations within them, loop tiling and loop fusion seem to be the most promising optimizations. Loop tiling can help with data locality and may enable more efficient use of on-chip memory. Loop fusion can reduce the overhead of loop iterations and potentially increase the workload for each pipeline stage, making better use of hardware resources.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax, int nx, int ny, double ex[60][80], double ey[60][80], double hz[60][80], double _fict_[40]) {
    int t, i, j;

    // Original pragmas are included as per the requirement.
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

    for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
        // Loop fusion for ey updates
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
        for (i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
                if (i == 0) {
                    ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];
                } else {
                    ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Loop fusion for ex and hz updates can be considered but requires careful handling of dependencies.
        // For this example, we keep ex and hz updates separate to maintain clarity and correctness.

        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0_2}
        #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0_2}
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_2}
        for (i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
            for (j = 1; j < 80; j++) {
                ex[i][j] = ex[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0_3}
        #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0_3}
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_3}
        for (i = 0; i < 59; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < 79; j++) {
                hz[i][j] = hz[i][j] - 0.7 * (ex[i][j + 1] - ex[i][j] + ey[i + 1][j] - ey[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion for `ey` Updates**: By fusing the loop that initializes `ey[0][j]` with the loop that updates `ey[i][j]`, we reduce the number of loop iterations and potentially increase data locality. This fusion is safe because the operations within the fused loop do not have dependencies that would be violated by the fusion.
// 
// 2. **Maintaining Separate Loops for `ex` and `hz` Updates**: Although loop fusion could potentially be applied here as well, the dependencies between `ex` and `hz` updates require careful handling. Incorrect fusion could lead to data hazards. Therefore, for clarity and correctness, these loops are kept separate in this transformation.
// 
// 3. **Original Pragmas Preserved**: All original pragmas (`PIPELINE`, `TILE`, `PARALLEL`) are preserved and applied to the transformed loops to ensure that the compiler's HLS directives for parallelism and pipelining are maintained.
// 
// This transformed code aims to balance between optimizing for performance and ensuring correctness by carefully choosing where to apply loop fusion and where to maintain separation between loop iterations due to data dependencies.
