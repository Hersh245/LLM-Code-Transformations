// Given the performance estimates and the provided code snippet, it's clear that the majority of the execution time is spent in the nested loops for calculating the correlation matrix (`loop i` at `cnn-krnl.cpp:68`). This section of the code accounts for approximately 96.5% of the total accumulated cycles. Therefore, optimizations should primarily focus on this part of the code.
// 
// However, it's important to consider the entire code for possible optimizations that might reduce the overall execution time. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#include <math.h>
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_correlation(double float_n, double data[100][80], double corr[80][80], double mean[80], double stddev[80]) {
  int i, j, k;
  double eps = 0.1;

  // No change here, as the original loop order seems optimal for memory access patterns.
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    mean[j] = 0.0;
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      mean[j] += data[i][j];
    }
    mean[j] /= float_n;
  }

  // No change here as well, since the loop is already optimized for the given task.
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    stddev[j] = 0.0;
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L5}
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      stddev[j] += pow(data[i][j] - mean[j], (double)2);
    }
    stddev[j] /= float_n;
    stddev[j] = sqrt(stddev[j]);
    stddev[j] = (stddev[j] <= eps ? 1.0 : stddev[j]);
  }

  // No change here, preprocessing data is necessary before the correlation calculation.
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      data[i][j] -= mean[j];
      data[i][j] /= sqrt(float_n) * stddev[j];
    }
  }

  // Loop interchange: This transformation is applied to improve data locality and cache usage.
  // The original code iterates over 'i' and 'j' in a way that might not be optimal for accessing 'data'.
  // By interchanging the loops, we can potentially improve the access pattern to 'data' and 'corr'.
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L3}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L3}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    corr[j][j] = 1.0;
    for (i = 0; i < j; i++) {
      corr[i][j] = 0.0;
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L7}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L7_0}
      for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
        corr[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
      }
      corr[j][i] = corr[i][j];
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Interchange in the Correlation Calculation:** The performance report indicates that the nested loops for calculating the correlation matrix are the most time-consuming part of the code. By interchanging the loops `i` and `j`, we aim to improve the spatial locality of the data accesses, which can lead to better cache utilization and potentially reduce the number of cache misses. This is because accessing `data[k][i]` and `data[k][j]` in the innermost loop with `j` as the outer loop might allow for more efficient use of loaded data when `k` is the same for consecutive iterations.
// 
// 2. **Preservation of Pragmas:** All original pragmas have been preserved and applied to the transformed loops accordingly. These pragmas are crucial for instructing the HLS tool on how to parallelize and optimize the loops for hardware implementation.
// 
// 3. **No Loop Tiling, Distribution, or Fusion Applied:** Given the structure of the loops and the operations within them, loop tiling, distribution, or fusion do not appear to be beneficial without further information on the hardware architecture or without causing significant changes to the algorithm that could impact correctness. The focus was on improving data locality through loop interchange.
// 
// This transformation aims to optimize the given code for HLS by focusing on the most time-consuming parts and attempting to improve data locality and cache utilization without altering the algorithm's correctness.
