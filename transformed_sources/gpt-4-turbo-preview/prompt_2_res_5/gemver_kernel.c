// Given the performance estimates and the original code, we can identify several opportunities for optimization. The primary bottlenecks appear to be the two nested loops for updating `x` and `w`, each consuming approximately 44.5% of the total cycles. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we'll consider loop transformations that can improve data locality, parallelism, and reduce pipeline initiation intervals (II). 
// 
// ### Original Performance Bottlenecks:
// 1. **Nested Loops for Updating `A`, `x`, and `w`**: High accumulated cycles due to the operations within these loops.
// 2. **Pipeline II for Loop `j`**: The pipeline initiation interval for the inner loops is not optimal, indicating potential data dependencies or insufficient parallelism.
// 
// ### Optimizations Applied:
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This can improve cache locality and potentially expose more parallelism. Applied to the nested loops that update `A`, `x`, and `w`.
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: Combining loops that iterate over the same range can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality. However, in this case, due to the dependencies between updates to `A`, `x`, and `w`, direct fusion seems inapplicable without altering the algorithm's semantics.
// 3. **Loop Unrolling**: Applied implicitly through the `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directive with `FACTOR=auto`, which should increase the amount of parallel work within each iteration.
// 
// ### Transformed Code:

// ### Rationale:
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to improve data locality and efficiency of memory access patterns. The choice of `TILE_SIZE` should be based on the specific hardware's cache size and architecture to balance between maximizing data reuse and minimizing cache evictions.
// - **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been preserved and applied to the tiled loops to ensure that the compiler's directives for parallelism, pipeline, and tile optimizations are respected.
// - **Implicit Loop Unrolling**: Through the use of `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` with `FACTOR=auto`, the compiler is instructed to automatically determine the best unrolling factor, which can enhance parallel execution within the hardware's capabilities.
// 
// ### Note:
// - The effectiveness of these optimizations should be validated through empirical testing and further refinement based on the specific target architecture's characteristics and the HLS tool's capabilities. Adjustments to `TILE_SIZE` and exploration of additional optimizations like loop interchange or advanced parallelization strategies might yield further improvements.
