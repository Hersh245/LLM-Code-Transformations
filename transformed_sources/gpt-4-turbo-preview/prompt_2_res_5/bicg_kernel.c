// Given the performance estimates and the original code, we can see that the majority of the cycles are spent in the nested loop structure within the `kernel_bicg` function. The inner loop (`loop j`) is particularly expensive in terms of cycles per call. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply a combination of loop transformations that aim to reduce the number of cycles and improve data access patterns.
// 
// ### Optimized Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg_optimized(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124]) {
    int i, j;
    double temp_s[116] = {0.0};
    double temp_q[124] = {0.0};

    // Initialize temporary arrays to accumulate results
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        temp_s[i] = 0.0;
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        temp_q[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // Loop fusion for better data locality and reduced memory accesses
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
        for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
            if (i < 116) {
                // Perform the original operation for 's' within bounds
                temp_s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
            }
            // Always perform the operation for 'q'
            temp_q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
        }
    }

    // Copy the accumulated results back to the original arrays
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        s[i] = temp_s[i];
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        q[i] = temp_q[i];
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: The original code separates the initialization of `s[i]` and the computation of `s[j]` and `q[i]`. By fusing these operations into a single loop structure, we can potentially reduce the overhead associated with loop control and improve data locality. However, since the initialization loop for `s[i]` has a different iteration space (116) compared to the main computation loop (124), we need to ensure that the operations for `s[j]` are performed only within the valid bounds. This is achieved by adding a conditional check `if (i < 116)` before updating `temp_s[j]`.
// 
// 2. **Temporary Accumulation Arrays**: Instead of directly updating the `s` and `q` arrays within the loop, we use temporary arrays (`temp_s` and `temp_q`) to accumulate the results. This can help in reducing the potential for write-after-read (WAR) or write-after-write (WAW) hazards, which can otherwise limit the effectiveness of pipelining and parallelization directives.
// 
// 3. **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been preserved and applied to the optimized loop structure to ensure that the compiler can still apply parallelization, pipelining, and tiling optimizations as appropriate. The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` and `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directives are particularly important for informing the HLS tool about potential parallelism and the desire for pipelining the loop iterations.
// 
// By applying these transformations, we aim to reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC) for the `kernel_bicg` function, thereby improving the overall performance of the code when synthesized for hardware acceleration.
