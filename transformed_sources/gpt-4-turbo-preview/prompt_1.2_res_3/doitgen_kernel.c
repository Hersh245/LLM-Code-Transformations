// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: We can interchange the loops to optimize memory access patterns. However, in this case, due to the dependencies in the computation of `sum[p]`, loop permutation might not offer significant benefits without changing the data access pattern significantly.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This is already hinted at in the code with `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}`, which suggests that loop tiling is intended but left for the compiler to decide. We can explicitly tile the loops for better control over memory access and to exploit data locality.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion**: The last two loops over `p` can be fused into a single loop to reduce the loop overhead and improve data locality. However, due to the dependency on the computation of `sum[p]` in the first loop before updating `A[r][q][p]` in the second loop, direct fusion is not possible without altering the logic.
// 
// 4. **Loop Distribution**: This is not directly applicable without changing the logic of the code, as the two loops over `p` are already separated by their functionality.
// 
// Given these considerations, the most straightforward optimization we can apply while keeping the original code structure is to make explicit tiling decisions for the loops and ensure that the pipeline pragmas are effectively utilized. Since the original code suggests using automatic decisions for tiling and pipelining, we'll focus on making these explicit based on hypothetical optimal tile sizes and pipeline stages, assuming a deeper understanding of the target architecture's capabilities.
// 
// Here's an example of how the code might be transformed with explicit tiling and maintained pipeline pragmas:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(int nr, int nq, int np, double A[25][20][30], double C4[30][30], double sum[30]) {
    int r, q, p, s;
    int r_tile, q_tile, p_tile;
    const int R_TILE_SIZE = 5; // Hypothetical tile sizes based on target architecture
    const int Q_TILE_SIZE = 5;
    const int P_TILE_SIZE = 10;

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
    for (r = 0; r < 25; r += R_TILE_SIZE) {
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
        for (q = 0; q < 20; q += Q_TILE_SIZE) {
            #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
            for (p = 0; p < 30; p += P_TILE_SIZE) {
                for (r_tile = r; r_tile < r + R_TILE_SIZE && r_tile < 25; ++r_tile) {
                    for (q_tile = q; q_tile < q + Q_TILE_SIZE && q_tile < 20; ++q_tile) {
                        for (p_tile = p; p_tile < p + P_TILE_SIZE && p_tile < 30; ++p_tile) {
                            sum[p_tile] = 0.0;
                            for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
                                sum[p_tile] += A[r_tile][q_tile][s] * C4[s][p_tile];
                            }
                        }
                        for (p_tile = p; p_tile < p + P_TILE_SIZE && p_tile < 30; ++p_tile) {
                            A[r_tile][q_tile][p_tile] = sum[p_tile];
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// Rationale behind transformations:
// - **Explicit Tiling**: By explicitly defining tile sizes and tiling the loops, we aim to improve data locality and cache utilization. This can significantly impact performance on many architectures by reducing memory access times.
// - **Maintained Pipeline Pragmas**: The pipeline pragmas are kept as they were, with an assumption that the compiler or HLS tool can automatically manage pipeline stages efficiently. However, explicit control over pipeline stages can be further optimized based on the target architecture's capabilities and the specific requirements of the algorithm.
// 
// It's important to note that the effectiveness of these transformations can vary significantly depending on the target architecture, the specific HLS toolchain used, and the broader context of the application. Therefore, iterative profiling and optimization may be necessary to achieve the best results.
