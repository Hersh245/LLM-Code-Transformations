// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latency. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: We distribute the second loop into two separate loops to separate the concerns of calculating `tmp` and updating `y`. This is already done in the provided code, so no changes are needed here.
// 
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: Not applicable here as loops are already optimally separated for parallel execution.
// 
// 3. **Loop Tiling**: This technique is beneficial for improving cache locality by processing data in smaller blocks. However, given the pragma hints (`#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}`), it seems the intention is to let the HLS tool decide the tiling factor automatically. For manual optimization, we would need specific knowledge about the target architecture's cache sizes.
// 
// 4. **Loop Permutation**: This technique can be applied to interchange the loop order to improve spatial locality. However, in this context, loop permutation is not directly applicable due to the dependencies in the loop body.
// 
// Given the constraints and the existing pragmas, the most significant improvements are likely to come from the HLS tool's ability to automatically parallelize and tile the loops based on the provided pragmas. However, we can ensure the code is clean and straightforward to allow the HLS tool to optimize effectively.
// 
// Here's the optimized code with explanations for each pragma:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m,int n,double A[116][124],double x[124],double y[124],double tmp[116])
{
  int i;
  int j;
  // Initialize y to 0
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) 
    y[i] = ((double )0);
  
  // This pragma suggests the compiler to pipeline the following loop.
  // Pipelining allows for loop iterations to be executed in parallel, improving throughput.
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
  // This pragma hints at automatic loop tiling for the next loop.
  // Loop tiling can improve cache utilization by working on smaller portions of the data at a time.
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  
  // This pragma suggests parallel execution of the following loop.
  // Parallelization can significantly speed up the execution on hardware that supports it.
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    tmp[i] = 0.0;
    
    // This pragma indicates that the loop can be parallelized with a reduction operation on tmp.
    // It allows for concurrent execution while ensuring tmp[i] accumulates correctly.
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
    }
    
    // Similar to the previous pragma, this one suggests parallel reduction on y.
    // This enables updating y[j] concurrently in a way that's safe and efficient.
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
    }
  }
}
// In this optimized version, the code structure is largely unchanged because the original code is already well-structured for HLS optimizations, with pragmas indicating where parallelism, pipelining, and tiling can be applied. The key to HLS optimization lies in effectively using these pragmas to guide the compiler, as manual loop transformations would require a deeper understanding of the target architecture's specifics, which are not provided.
