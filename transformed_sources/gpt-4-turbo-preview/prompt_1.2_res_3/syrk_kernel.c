// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latency. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This technique can be applied to break the loops into smaller chunks, which can help in fitting the data into faster, but smaller memory (like block RAM in FPGAs). However, given the pragmas already suggest tiling and the specific sizes of matrices involved, we might not manually tile these loops unless we have a specific target architecture in mind that requires it.
// 
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: We avoid fusing loops here as the operations within the loops are quite distinct and fusing them might reduce parallelism opportunities or complicate memory access patterns.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This technique is already implicitly applied in the separation of the multiplication and addition operations into different loops. It helps in making the loops more amenable to parallelization.
// 
// 4. **Loop Permutation**: This technique changes the order of nested loops to improve data locality or parallelism. In this case, permuting loops might not offer significant benefits without a deeper understanding of the target architecture's memory hierarchy.
// 
// Given the above considerations and the fact that the original code already includes pragmas for parallelization, pipelining, and tiling, major transformations might not be necessary beyond what's already suggested by the pragmas. However, ensuring that the pragmas are effectively utilized by the HLS tool is crucial. This often requires experimentation and profiling specific to the target hardware.
// 
// Here's the original code with comments on potential areas of consideration rather than transformation, as the pragmas suggest that the HLS tool is being guided to automatically handle parallelization and tiling:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60]) {
  int i, j, k;

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      if (j <= i) {
        C[i][j] *= beta;
      }
    }
    
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (k = 0; k < 60; k++) {
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
      for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
        if (j <= i) {
          C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// In this code:
// - The use of `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` suggests an attempt to execute loop iterations in an overlapped manner, which is crucial for achieving high throughput.
// - The `#pragma ACCEL TILE` hints at breaking down the data into smaller chunks, which can be particularly useful for fitting data into on-chip memory and reducing access times.
// - The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` indicates an effort to exploit data-level parallelism by allowing multiple iterations of the loop to execute concurrently.
// 
// For further optimization, one would need to consider the specific capabilities and limitations of the target FPGA architecture, such as the number of available DSP slices for parallel arithmetic operations, the size and bandwidth of on-chip memory resources, and the efficiency of the memory interface for loading and storing data. Experimentation with different tiling sizes, degrees of parallelism, and pipeline depths, guided by profiling and simulation results, would be essential steps in the optimization process.
