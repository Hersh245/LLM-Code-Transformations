// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce the latency and resource usage of the generated hardware. Here's how the code can be transformed:
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: We can attempt to fuse loops that iterate over the same range and do not have dependencies that would prevent fusion. However, in this case, due to the nature of the calculations (dependencies between `ey`, `ex`, and `hz` updates), loop fusion might not be directly applicable without altering the algorithm's correctness.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique is useful for improving data locality and can be applied to the nested loops iterating over `i` and `j`. However, since the pragma directives already suggest automatic tiling (`#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto`), explicit manual tiling might not be necessary unless we aim to fine-tune the tiling factor based on specific hardware constraints or to override the automatic decisions.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: This technique changes the loop nesting order to improve data locality or to enable other optimizations like vectorization. In this case, the loop order seems to be already optimized for the memory access patterns (row-major order in C).
// 
// Given the above considerations and the constraints imposed by the algorithm's dependencies, the most relevant transformation we can apply while respecting the original pragma directives is to ensure that the code structure is clear and that we respect the dependencies between different parts of the algorithm.
// 
// Since the original code is already structured to exploit parallelism (`#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto`) and pipeline execution (`#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto`), and given the automatic tiling, we'll focus on maintaining clarity and ensuring that any manual transformations do not conflict with these directives.
// 
// Here's the transformed code, which essentially remains the same due to the reasons explained above:

// In this case, the transformations are minimal due to the specific structure of the FDTD algorithm and the constraints it imposes on data dependencies. The use of pragmas suggests that the intention is to rely on the compiler's or the HLS tool's automatic optimizations for parallelism, pipelining, and tiling. Manual transformations would need to be carefully considered to avoid violating data dependencies or algorithm correctness.
