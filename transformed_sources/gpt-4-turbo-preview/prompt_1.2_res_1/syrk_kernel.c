// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we'll apply several code transformations aimed at improving parallelism, data locality, and reducing the number of redundant computations. The transformations include loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, and potentially loop fusion. However, due to the nature of the code and the target optimizations, not all of these transformations might be applicable or beneficial.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// The original code performs a symmetric rank-k update (SYRK) operation, which is a common BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) operation. The operation is defined for lower triangular matrices, as indicated by the condition `if (j <= i)` inside the loops. The code consists of two main parts:
// 1. Scaling the lower triangular part of matrix `C` by `beta`.
// 2. Performing the rank-k update on the lower triangular part of matrix `C` using matrix `A` and scaling factor `alpha`.
// 
// ### Optimized Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk_optimized(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Apply loop tiling to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // Tile sizes are chosen based on typical FPGA on-chip memory sizes and access patterns.
  // Adjust TILE_SIZE_I and TILE_SIZE_J based on the specific FPGA characteristics.
  const int TILE_SIZE_I = 20; // Example tile size for 'i' loop
  const int TILE_SIZE_J = 20; // Example tile size for 'j' loop

  // Loop distribution applied to separate the scaling of C and the update of C.
  // This helps in applying different optimizations for each part.

  // Part 1: Scaling C by beta
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i += TILE_SIZE_I) {
    for (j = 0; j <= i; j += TILE_SIZE_J) { // Adjusted loop bounds for triangular access

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
      for (int ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE_I && ii < 80; ii++) {
        for (int jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE_J && jj <= ii; jj++) {
          C[ii][jj] *= beta;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Part 2: Performing the rank-k update
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i += TILE_SIZE_I) {
    for (j = 0; j <= i; j += TILE_SIZE_J) { // Adjusted loop bounds for triangular access

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
      for (k = 0; k < 60; k++) {

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
        for (int ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE_I && ii < 80; ii++) {
          for (int jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE_J && jj <= ii; jj++) {
            C[ii][jj] += alpha * A[ii][k] * A[jj][k];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to both the scaling and updating parts of the code to improve data locality. By working on smaller sub-matrices, we can make better use of the FPGA's on-chip memory, reducing the need for slower off-chip memory accesses. This is particularly effective for FPGAs due to their limited but fast on-chip memory resources.
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: Separating the scaling of `C` by `beta` and the rank-k update allows us to apply different optimizations (like tiling) more effectively to each part. This also makes the code structure clearer and can help in further parallelization efforts.
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Adjusting loop bounds and orders within the tiled loops to ensure that memory accesses are as sequential as possible, improving memory access patterns and potentially increasing the efficiency of the memory subsystem.
// 4. **Parallelism**: The use of `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` and `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directives is maintained and adjusted to the transformed loop structure to exploit parallelism at different levels of the computation.
// 
// ### Note
// - The tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I` and `TILE_SIZE_J`) are chosen as examples. In practice, these should be tuned based on the specific FPGA architecture and the available on-chip memory resources to achieve optimal performance.
// - Further optimizations might include exploring different tile sizes, adjusting parallelism factors, and potentially applying additional HLS-specific optimizations based on the target FPGA architecture.
