// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gemver(int n, double alpha, double beta, double A[120][120], double u1[120], double v1[120], double u2[120], double v2[120], double w[120], double x[120], double y[120], double z[120])
{
    int i, j, ii, jj;
    const int TILE_SIZE = 30; // Assuming TILE_SIZE is a factor of 120 for simplicity

#pragma scop

    // Original loop for A[i][j] update with loop tiling applied
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=A FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
            for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE; i++) {
                for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE; j++) {
                    A[i][j] += u1[i] * v1[j] + u2[i] * v2[j];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Loop for x[i] update with loop distribution applied to separate reduction operations
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
        double temp_x = 0;
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=temp_x FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L5}
        for (j = 0; j < 120; j++) {
            temp_x += beta * A[j][i] * y[j];
        }
        x[i] = temp_x + z[i]; // Combining operations to reduce the number of loops
    }

    // Loop for w[i] update remains mostly unchanged but could benefit from loop tiling if necessary
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L3}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L3}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
        double temp_w = 0;
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=temp_w FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
        for (j = 0; j < 120; j++) {
            temp_w += alpha * A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        w[i] = temp_w;
    }

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the first loop that updates matrix `A`. This transformation improves data locality and cache usage by working on smaller sub-matrices (tiles) at a time. It can also enhance parallelism opportunities within each tile.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: Applied to the loop updating `x[i]`. Originally, the loop contained two distinct operations: multiplication-accumulation and addition with `z[i]`. By combining these operations into a single loop after the multiplication-accumulation, we reduce the total number of loop iterations required, which can lead to reduced latency and improved resource utilization.
// 
// 3. **Combining Operations**: Instead of having a separate loop to add `z[i]` to `x[i]`, this operation is combined with the loop that performs the multiplication-accumulation for `x[i]`. This reduces the number of loops and thus the overhead associated with loop control.
// 
// 4. **Parallelism and Pipelining Pragmas**: The original pragmas are maintained to hint at the compiler for automatic parallelization, pipelining, and tiling. These pragmas instruct the HLS tool to explore automatic optimization strategies for parallel execution and efficient resource utilization. The `reduction` pragma is particularly important for ensuring that parallel reductions do not lead to race conditions and are correctly synthesized.
// 
// These transformations aim to optimize the code for HLS by improving parallelism, reducing latency, and enhancing data locality, which are crucial for achieving high performance in hardware implementations.
