// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can consider several transformations. The original code already includes directives for parallelization and pipelining, which are crucial for HLS. However, we can further optimize the code by applying loop transformations that enhance data locality and parallelism, and reduce the overhead of loop control. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_adi(int tsteps, int n, double u[60][60], double v[60][60], double p[60][60], double q[60][60]) {
  int t, i, j;
  double DX = 1.0 / 60;
  double DY = 1.0 / 60;
  double DT = 1.0 / 40;
  double B1 = 2.0;
  double B2 = 1.0;
  double mul1 = B1 * DT / (DX * DX);
  double mul2 = B2 * DT / (DY * DY);
  double a = -mul1 / 2.0;
  double b = 1.0 + mul1;
  double c = a;
  double d = -mul2 / 2.0;
  double e = 1.0 + mul2;
  double f = d;

  for (t = 1; t <= 40; t++) {
    // Column Sweep
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (i = 1; i < 59; i++) {
      v[0][i] = 1.0;
      p[i][0] = 0.0;
      q[i][0] = v[0][i];
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 1; j < 59; j++) {
        p[i][j] = -c / (a * p[i][j - 1] + b);
        q[i][j] = (-d * u[j][i - 1] + (1.0 + 2.0 * d) * u[j][i] - f * u[j][i + 1] - a * q[i][j - 1]) / (a * p[i][j - 1] + b);
      }
      v[59][i] = 1.0;
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 58; j >= 1; j--) {
        v[j][i] = p[i][j] * v[j + 1][i] + q[i][j];
      }
    }

    // Row Sweep
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (i = 1; i < 59; i++) {
      u[i][0] = 1.0;
      p[i][0] = 0.0;
      q[i][0] = u[i][0];
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 1; j < 59; j++) {
        p[i][j] = -f / (d * p[i][j - 1] + e);
        q[i][j] = (-a * v[i - 1][j] + (1.0 + 2.0 * a) * v[i][j] - c * v[i + 1][j] - d * q[i][j - 1]) / (d * p[i][j - 1] + e);
      }
      u[i][59] = 1.0;
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 58; j >= 1; j--) {
        u[i][j] = p[i][j] * u[i][j + 1] + q[i][j];
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Inversion for Backward Iterations**: The original code uses a non-standard loop form for backward iterations, which can be confusing and might not be efficiently optimized by HLS tools. By converting these loops to standard backward loops, we make the intention clearer and potentially enable better optimization by the HLS compiler.
// 
// 2. **Maintaining Pragmas**: All original pragmas for parallelization and pipelining are kept intact. These pragmas are crucial for instructing the HLS tool on how to optimize the loops for parallel execution and pipelining, which are key for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC implementations.
// 
// 3. **Simplification**: The loop bounds and indices are simplified to make the code cleaner and potentially easier for the HLS tools to analyze and optimize. For example, using `59` directly instead of `60 - 1` makes the code more readable and straightforward.
// 
// 4. **Avoiding Unnecessary Variables**: The original code recalculates loop indices in a complex manner for backward iterations. By directly using the loop variable in a standard decrementing loop, we avoid unnecessary complexity and potentially enable better optimization opportunities for the HLS compiler.
// 
// These transformations aim to maintain the original functionality while enhancing the code's suitability for high-level synthesis, potentially leading to better performance and resource utilization in the synthesized hardware.
