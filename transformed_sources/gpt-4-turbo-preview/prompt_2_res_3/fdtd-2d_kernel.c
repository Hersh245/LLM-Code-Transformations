// Given the performance estimates and the original code, we can apply several optimizations to improve the performance for High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The primary goals are to reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC), and potentially improve data locality and parallelism. Here is an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax, int nx, int ny, double ex[60][80], double ey[60][80], double hz[60][80], double _fict_[40]) {
  int t, i, j;

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
    
    // Loop fusion for ey updates
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
    for (i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
      for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
        if (i == 0) {
          ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];
        } else {
          ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);
        }
      }
    }

    // Loop tiling for ex updates
    #define TILE_SIZE_X 10
    #define TILE_SIZE_Y 20
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0_1}
    for (i = 0; i < 60; i += TILE_SIZE_X) {
      for (j = 1; j < 80; j += TILE_SIZE_Y) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
        for (int ti = i; ti < i + TILE_SIZE_X && ti < 60; ti++) {
          for (int tj = j; tj < j + TILE_SIZE_Y && tj < 80; tj++) {
            ex[ti][tj] = ex[ti][tj] - 0.5 * (hz[ti][tj] - hz[ti][tj - 1]);
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // Loop permutation for hz updates
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0_3}
    for (j = 0; j < 79; j++) {
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_3}
      for (i = 0; i < 59; i++) {
        hz[i][j] = hz[i][j] - 0.7 * (ex[i][j + 1] - ex[i][j] + ey[i + 1][j] - ey[i][j]);
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion for `ey` Updates**: The original code had separate loops for updating `ey[0][j]` and the rest of `ey[i][j]`. Fusing these loops into a single loop with a conditional check improves data locality and reduces the overhead of loop iteration. This transformation is expected to reduce the AC and CPC for the `ey` update section.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling for `ex` Updates**: Loop tiling, also known as loop blocking, is applied to the loop updating `ex`. This transformation aims to improve cache utilization by working on smaller, contiguous blocks of the array at a time. The choice of tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_X` and `TILE_SIZE_Y`) can be tuned based on the cache size and architecture specifics. This optimization is particularly effective for large data sets.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation for `hz` Updates**: Changing the loop order (loop permutation) for the `hz` update section can improve memory access patterns, leading to better cache performance. In this case, iterating over `j` before `i` might align better with the memory layout of `hz`, `ex`, and `ey`, potentially reducing cache misses.
// 
// Each of these transformations maintains the original pragma directives to ensure that the compiler's HLS optimizations (like pipelining, tiling, and parallelization) are still applied. The effectiveness of these optimizations would ultimately need to be verified through synthesis and simulation, with potential further tuning based on the results.
