// Given the performance estimates from the report, it's clear that the most time-consuming part of the code is within the nested loops starting at `cnn-krnl.cpp:44`. Specifically, the loop nest involving `i`, `j`, and `k` accounts for 98.5% of the accumulated cycles. This suggests that optimizing this part of the code could yield significant performance improvements. Below is a transformed version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied.

        cov[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
      }
      cov[i][j] /= float_n - 1.0;

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: The original code calculates the covariance matrix by iterating over `i` and `j` in the outer loops, with `k` in the innermost loop. Given the high cost of these loops, permuting them could potentially improve data locality and cache usage. However, due to the dependencies in calculating the covariance matrix, only a limited permutation is possible. In the transformed code, the loop order is adjusted to iterate over `j` first, then `i`, and finally `k`. This change is made to explore potential improvements in accessing the `data` array, which might enhance cache performance. The condition in the `i` loop is adjusted to ensure that we only compute the upper triangular part of the covariance matrix once, and then mirror it, which preserves the original logic while potentially reducing the number of iterations.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling, Distribution, Fusion**: These techniques were considered, but given the structure of the code and the need to maintain the logic for calculating the mean, subtracting the mean from `data`, and computing the covariance, there's limited scope for their effective application without altering the algorithm's behavior. The primary focus was on loop permutation as a means to potentially enhance data locality and cache performance.
// 
// 3. **Maintaining Pragmas**: All original pragmas were kept as requested, ensuring that any compiler or tool-specific optimizations related to parallelism, pipelining, and tiling could still be applied to the transformed code.
// 
// The effectiveness of these transformations would ultimately need to be verified by compiling the transformed code with the HLS tool, running it, and comparing the new performance metrics to the original ones.
