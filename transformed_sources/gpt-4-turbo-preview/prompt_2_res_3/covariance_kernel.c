// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several loop optimizations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, and loop fusion. These optimizations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and reduce memory access latency. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_covariance(int m, int n, double float_n, double data[100][80], double cov[80][80], double mean[80]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop permutation applied to improve data locality in calculating mean
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      mean[j] += data[i][j];
    }
  }
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    mean[j] /= float_n;
  }

  // Loop permutation applied to improve data locality in subtracting mean
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      data[i][j] -= mean[j];
    }
  }

  // Loop distribution applied to separate initialization of cov matrix
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    for (j = i; j < 80; j++) {
      cov[i][j] = 0.0;
    }
  }

  // Main computation of covariance with loop permutation for better data locality
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    for (j = i; j < 80; j++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=cov FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
      for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
        cov[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
      }
      cov[i][j] /= float_n - 1.0;
      cov[j][i] = cov[i][j];
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: The original code calculates the mean and then subtracts it from the data in separate loops. The inner loops iterate over different dimensions, which can lead to poor data locality. By permuting the loops (swapping the order of `i` and `j` loops), we ensure that data accessed in memory is contiguous, which improves cache utilization and reduces memory access latency.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The original code initializes the `cov` matrix within the same loop that computes the covariance values. By distributing the loops, we separate the initialization from the computation. This simplifies the loop body, making it easier for the HLS tool to optimize and parallelize the computation part without worrying about the initialization part.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion**: Although not directly applied here as an optimization, it's important to note that loop fusion could be considered if there were multiple loops with the same loop bounds doing different operations on the same data set. In this case, however, focusing on loop permutation and distribution was more relevant to the given code's structure.
// 
// 4. **Pragma Directives**: The original pragma directives for pipeline, tile, and parallel are retained and appropriately placed to hint the HLS tool for potential parallelism and pipelining opportunities. Adjusting these directives according to the loop transformations helps the HLS tool better understand the intended optimizations.
// 
// These transformations aim to enhance parallelism, improve data locality, and enable more efficient use of resources during hardware synthesis, leading to potentially higher performance and lower resource utilization in the synthesized hardware.
