// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the code, the primary focus should be on optimizing the nested loops that consume the majority of the execution time. The performance estimates suggest that the loops iterating over `i`, `j`, and `k` are the most time-consuming parts of the code. To optimize these, we can apply loop tiling to improve data locality, and loop fusion to reduce the overhead from loop initializations and terminations. Loop permutation might also be beneficial to ensure the innermost loop has the highest data locality.

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is applied to improve cache locality by processing the data in small blocks that fit into the cache. This is particularly effective for the nested loops iterating over `i`, `j`, and `k`, as it reduces cache misses when accessing elements of arrays `A` and `B`.
// 
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: Although not explicitly applied in the transformed code (since the original loops were already tightly coupled), it's worth noting that combining loops that iterate over the same range can reduce loop overhead. In this case, the focus was more on tiling, which is a form of loop transformation that implicitly fuses the computation within smaller blocks.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: This optimization wasn't explicitly applied in the transformed code, but the order of the loops was carefully considered to ensure that the innermost loop has the highest data locality. This is inherently maintained in the structure of the loop tiling transformation.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is expected to have improved performance due to better utilization of the cache and reduced memory access times. The specific impact on trip count (TC), accumulated cycles (AC), and cycles per call (CPC) would need to be evaluated through profiling and simulation in an HLS tool.
