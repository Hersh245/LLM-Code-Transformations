// Based on the performance estimate provided, the majority of the execution time is spent within the two nested loops inside the `for (t = 1; t <= 40; t++)` loop, each contributing to 50% of the total accumulated cycles. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations targeting these loops. Given the structure of the code and the performance estimates, loop tiling and loop fusion seem less applicable due to the nature of the dependencies within the loops. However, loop permutation could be beneficial, especially if it aligns better with the memory access patterns and reduces cache misses. Since the innermost loops are already being parallelized and pipelined, the focus should be on optimizing the memory access patterns and possibly increasing the granularity of parallelism if dependencies allow.
// 
// Given the provided information, a direct application of loop permutation, tiling, or fusion might not lead to significant improvements without a deeper understanding of the data dependencies, especially between `u`, `v`, `p`, and `q`. However, ensuring that memory accesses are as sequential as possible can lead to performance improvements. The current loop ordering seems to be already optimized for memory access patterns given the row-major order storage of C arrays.
// 
// Here's an optimized version of the code that maintains the original pragmas but attempts to make minor adjustments for clarity and potential performance, acknowledging that without further details on the memory access patterns and dependencies, significant structural changes are risky:
