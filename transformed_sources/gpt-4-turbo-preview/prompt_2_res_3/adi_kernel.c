// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can consider several transformations. The primary goals are to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_adi(int tsteps, int n, double u[60][60], double v[60][60], double p[60][60], double q[60][60]) {
  int t, i, j;
  double DX = 1.0 / 60.0;
  double DY = 1.0 / 60.0;
  double DT = 1.0 / 40.0;
  double B1 = 2.0;
  double B2 = 1.0;
  double mul1 = B1 * DT / (DX * DX);
  double mul2 = B2 * DT / (DY * DY);
  double a = -mul1 / 2.0;
  double b = 1.0 + mul1;
  double c = a;
  double d = -mul2 / 2.0;
  double e = 1.0 + mul2;
  double f = d;

  for (t = 1; t <= 40; t++) {
    // Column Sweep
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (i = 1; i < 59; i++) {
      v[0][i] = 1.0;
      p[i][0] = 0.0;
      q[i][0] = v[0][i];
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 1; j < 59; j++) {
        p[i][j] = -c / (a * p[i][j - 1] + b);
        q[i][j] = (-d * u[j][i - 1] + (1.0 + 2.0 * d) * u[j][i] - f * u[j][i + 1] - a * q[i][j - 1]) / (a * p[i][j - 1] + b);
      }
      v[59][i] = 1.0;
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 58; j >= 1; j--) {
        v[j][i] = p[i][j] * v[j + 1][i] + q[i][j];
      }
    }
    // Row Sweep
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (i = 1; i < 59; i++) {
      u[i][0] = 1.0;
      p[i][0] = 0.0;
      q[i][0] = u[i][0];
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 1; j < 59; j++) {
        p[i][j] = -f / (d * p[i][j - 1] + e);
        q[i][j] = (-a * v[i - 1][j] + (1.0 + 2.0 * a) * v[i][j] - c * v[i + 1][j] - d * q[i][j - 1]) / (d * p[i][j - 1] + e);
      }
      u[i][59] = 1.0;
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 58; j >= 1; j--) {
        u[i][j] = p[i][j] * u[i][j + 1] + q[i][j];

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Inversion for Backward Iteration**: The original code uses a non-standard loop for backward iteration with a calculation for the loop index inside the loop body. This is replaced with a standard backward loop, which is more readable and potentially easier for the HLS tool to optimize.
// 
// 2. **Pipeline Pragmas**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directive is applied to the outer loops (`i` loops) of both the column and row sweeps. This transformation attempts to execute iterations of these loops in parallel, where possible, improving the throughput of the loop execution.
// 
// 3. **Parallel Pragmas**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directive is used inside the innermost loops to suggest that iterations can be executed in parallel. This is crucial for loops that have independent iterations, which is often the case in numerical algorithms like this one.
// 
// 4. **Loop Tiling and Distribution**: The original code does not lend itself well to loop tiling due to the dependencies involved in the computations of `p` and `q`. However, ensuring that the data accessed is localized (which is a benefit of tiling) is somewhat naturally handled by the algorithm's structure. Loop distribution wasn't applied explicitly here as the original loop structures are already quite optimized for the dependencies they contain.
// 
// 5. **Removed Redundant Pragmas and Comments**: Some pragmas and comments (like `#pragma scop`) were removed for clarity, as they don't directly influence the HLS transformations discussed here.
// 
// 6. **Code Simplification**: Simplified the initialization of `DX`, `DY`, and `DT` for readability. This doesn't affect performance but makes the code easier to understand.
// 
// These transformations aim to make the code more parallelizable and efficient when synthesized to hardware, taking advantage of FPGA architectures' capabilities to execute many operations in parallel.
