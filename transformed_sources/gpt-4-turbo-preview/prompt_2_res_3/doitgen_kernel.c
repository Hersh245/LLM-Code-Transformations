// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the code, we can apply several optimizations to improve the performance for High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The key transformations that could be beneficial are loop permutation, loop tiling, and loop distribution. These transformations aim to optimize memory access patterns and parallelism, which are crucial for achieving high performance in HLS.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// The original code has nested loops with significant time spent in the innermost loops. The performance estimate indicates that the majority of the cycles are spent within the loop labeled `r`. This suggests that optimizing the inner loops could yield significant performance improvements.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can improve data locality and reduce cache misses. In this case, permuting the loops `p` and `s` might be beneficial because it could lead to better utilization of the `sum` array and `C4` matrix.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique can be applied to break the loops into smaller chunks that fit into the cache, reducing memory access times. However, given the provided pragmas and the nature of the computation, it's not immediately clear if manual tiling would outperform the auto tiling already suggested by the pragmas. Careful consideration is needed here.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This involves splitting a loop into multiple loops to separate concerns and potentially enable more parallelism or better memory access patterns. In this case, distributing the loop that accumulates `sum[p]` and the loop that updates `A[r][q][p]` might make it easier to optimize each part independently.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
// Given the above analysis, here's a version of the code with loop permutation and an attempt to optimize based on the performance estimates:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(int nr, int nq, int np, double A[25][20][30], double C4[30][30], double sum[30]) {
  int r, q, p, s;

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  for (r = 0; r < 25; r++) {
    
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
    for (q = 0; q < 20; q++) {
      
      // Initialize sum array outside the loop over 'p' for better locality
      for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
        sum[p] = 0.0;
      }
      
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
      #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
      for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
        for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
          sum[p] += A[r][q][s] * C4[s][p];
        }
      }
      
      for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
        A[r][q][p] = sum[p];
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale
// - **Loop Permutation**: The loop over `s` and `p` inside the accumulation of `sum[p]` has been interchanged to potentially improve data locality and cache usage. This change might allow for more efficient use of the `C4` matrix and the `sum` array.
// - **Loop Distribution**: The initialization of `sum[p]` has been moved outside the loop over `s` but still within the loop over `q`, ensuring that `sum[p]` is correctly reset for each iteration of `q`. This separation could potentially allow for better optimization opportunities by the HLS tool.
// - **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been preserved to ensure that the compiler's auto optimization features (like pipeline and tile) are still applied. These pragmas hint at the compiler to apply specific optimizations that might not be explicitly detailed in the code but are crucial for achieving high performance.
// 
// ### Conclusion
// The transformed code aims to optimize memory access patterns and computational efficiency through loop permutation and distribution while preserving the compiler's ability to apply further optimizations through pragmas. The effectiveness of these transformations would need to be verified by compiling the transformed code with the HLS tool and comparing the new performance estimates to the original ones.
