// Given the performance estimates and the original code, we can apply several optimizations to improve the performance for High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The primary focus will be on reducing the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC) by applying loop transformations such as loop tiling, loop permutation, and loop distribution. These transformations aim to enhance data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// - The loop `i` (line 18) and its nested loops over `j` are the most computationally intensive parts of the code.
// - The first nested loop over `j` (line 22) has a pipeline initiation interval (II) of 5, which is higher than the second nested loop over `j` (line 27) with an II of 1. This indicates that the first loop is less efficiently pipelined and could benefit from optimization.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This can be applied to both `i` and `j` loops to improve cache utilization and possibly enable more parallel execution.
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Swapping the order of the nested loops might not be directly applicable due to data dependencies, but it's worth considering after loop tiling.
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: Separating the two nested `j` loops might enable more efficient pipelining and parallelism opportunities.
//

void kernel_atax(int m, int n, double A[116][124], double x[124], double y[124], double tmp[116]) {
    int i, j;

    // Initialize y to 0
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++)
        y[i] = ((double)0);

    // Apply loop tiling for better cache locality and potential parallelism

            for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_I && i < 116; i++) {
                tmp[i] = 0.0;

                // Loop distribution applied here, separating the original loop j into two parts
                #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
                for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < 124; j++) {
                    tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
                }

                #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
                for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < 124; j++) {
                    y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// - **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is applied to both `i` and `j` loops to potentially reduce the number of cache misses and improve the efficiency of memory accesses. It also opens up opportunities for parallel execution within tiles.
// - **Loop Distribution**: By separating the computations within the innermost loop, we can potentially increase the efficiency of pipelining and parallel execution. This is because each part of the distributed loop can be optimized independently.
// - **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas are preserved and applied to the transformed code to ensure that the compiler's directives for parallelism and pipelining are maintained.
// 
// These transformations aim to reduce the overall accumulated cycles (AC) and improve the cycles per call (CPC) by enhancing data locality, enabling more efficient pipelining, and increasing parallelism opportunities.
