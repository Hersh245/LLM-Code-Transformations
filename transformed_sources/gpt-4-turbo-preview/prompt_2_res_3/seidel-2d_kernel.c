// Given the performance estimate, it's clear that the majority of cycles are spent within the nested loops. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations such as loop tiling, loop permutation, and loop unrolling. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and reduce the overall execution time.
// 
// ### Loop Tiling
// Loop tiling can help with improving data locality and can potentially make better use of the cache. Given the size of `A` and the access pattern, tiling the `i` and `j` loops could be beneficial.
// 
// ### Loop Permutation
// Loop permutation might help in improving data access patterns, depending on how data is accessed and stored in memory. For this specific case, since we're accessing array `A` in a row-major order, the current loop order seems to be optimal for spatial locality. However, experimentation with loop order could be performed to verify this.
// 
// ### Loop Unrolling
// Loop unrolling can help to reduce the overhead of loop control and increase the level of parallelism. The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directive suggests that the compiler is already attempting to parallelize loops, but manual unrolling might further improve performance.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformation
// Given the above, a potential transformation could focus on tiling the `i` and `j` loops. Loop unrolling for the innermost loop (`j` loop) will also be considered. The original pragmas will be included to ensure that the compiler's optimization directives are respected.

    int t, i, j;
    int ii, jj;

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (t = 0; t <= 39; t++) {

        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
        #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
        for (ii = 1; ii <= 118; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
            for (jj = 1; jj <= 118; jj += TILE_SIZE) {

                #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
                for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i <= 118; i++) {
                    for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j <= 118; j++) {
                        A[i][j] = (A[i - 1][j - 1] + A[i - 1][j] + A[i - 1][j + 1] + A[i][j - 1] + A[i][j] + A[i][j + 1] + A[i + 1][j - 1] + A[i + 1][j] + A[i + 1][j + 1]) / 9.0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to both `i` and `j` loops to potentially improve cache utilization.
// - **Loop Unrolling**: Not explicitly shown, but the smaller tile size effectively acts as a form of unrolling, especially for the innermost loops. The compiler's parallelization pragmas are expected to further enhance this effect.
// - **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas were kept to ensure that the compiler's intended optimizations are not hindered.
// 
// ### Note
// The effectiveness of these transformations heavily depends on the target architecture and the specific HLS tool being used. It's crucial to experiment with different tile sizes and to profile the transformed code to ensure that the optimizations have the desired effect.
