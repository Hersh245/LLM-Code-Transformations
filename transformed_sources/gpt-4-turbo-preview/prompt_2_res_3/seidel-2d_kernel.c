// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's an overview of the transformations applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation helps in improving data locality by breaking the loops into smaller chunks. It's particularly useful for the inner loops iterating over `i` and `j`. We'll choose a tile size that fits well with the target architecture's memory hierarchy.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can sometimes improve data locality and parallelism. However, in this specific case, due to the data dependencies in the calculation of `A[i][j]`, loop permutation might not be directly applicable without affecting the correctness of the program.
// 
// 3. **Loop Unrolling**: This can be considered for the innermost loop to increase the level of parallelism and reduce loop control overhead. However, since the pragma `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto` is already hinting at automatic parallelization, explicit loop unrolling might not be necessary unless we aim for a specific unroll factor that the compiler might not choose.
// 
// Given these considerations, the primary transformation applied here will be loop tiling for the `i` and `j` loops. We'll choose a tile size, but since the pragma uses `FACTOR=auto`, we'll keep it symbolic for demonstration purposes.
// 
// Transformed Code:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_seidel_2d(int tsteps, int n, double A[120][120]) {
    int t, i, j, ii, jj;
    const int TILE_SIZE_I = 30; // Example tile size, adjust based on architecture
    const int TILE_SIZE_J = 30; // Example tile size, adjust based on architecture

    //#pragma scop

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (t = 0; t <= 39; t++) {

        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}

        #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}

        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
        for (ii = 1; ii <= 118; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
            for (jj = 1; jj <= 118; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {

                int i_upper = ii + TILE_SIZE_I > 118 ? 118 : ii + TILE_SIZE_I;
                int j_upper = jj + TILE_SIZE_J > 118 ? 118 : jj + TILE_SIZE_J;

                #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
                for (i = ii; i < i_upper; i++) {
                    for (j = jj; j < j_upper; j++) {
                        A[i][j] = (A[i - 1][j - 1] + A[i - 1][j] + A[i - 1][j + 1] + A[i][j - 1] + A[i][j] + A[i][j + 1] + A[i + 1][j - 1] + A[i + 1][j] + A[i + 1][j + 1]) / 9.0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    //#pragma endscop
}
// Rationale:
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to both `i` and `j` loops to improve cache locality and potentially enable better parallelization. The tile sizes are chosen as examples and should be tuned based on the target architecture's cache sizes and memory bandwidth.
// - **Loop Order**: The original loop order is preserved due to data dependencies.
// - **Automatic Parallelization and Pipeline Directives**: Retained from the original code to let the HLS tool automatically manage parallelization and pipelining, which can be more efficient due to the tool's understanding of the target architecture.
// 
// This transformed code aims to balance between manual optimization (loop tiling) and relying on the HLS tool's capabilities for parallelization and pipelining.
