// Based on the performance estimates provided, the most time-consuming parts of the code are the two nested loops for updating `x` and `w`. Both of these loops consume approximately 44.5% of the total execution time each. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations focusing on these critical parts. Loop tiling can be particularly effective in improving data locality and cache usage, which might reduce the execution time. Loop permutation might also be beneficial if it aligns better with memory access patterns. Given that the performance bottleneck is primarily due to these loops, focusing on them would yield the most significant performance improvements.

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to all the nested loops to improve cache locality. By working on smaller sub-matrices (tiles) at a time, it's more likely that the data accessed by the operations within a tile will remain in cache between accesses, reducing the number of cache misses and thus improving performance.
// 
// 2. **Loop Order**: The original order of loops is preserved because the primary transformations are focused on loop tiling, which doesn't necessitate changing the loop order. However, careful consideration was given to ensure that the innermost loops access memory in a pattern that is as contiguous as possible, which is beneficial for memory access efficiency.
// 
// 3. **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been preserved and applied to the outer loops of the tiled versions. This ensures that the compiler's directives for parallelization, pipelining, and other optimizations are still considered during HLS.
// 
// 4. **Tile Size**: The `TILE_SIZE` is a parameter that can be tuned based on the target architecture's cache size and other characteristics. A size of 30 is chosen as an example, but this would ideally be determined through empirical testing and optimization for a specific hardware target.
// 
// These transformations aim to reduce the execution time by improving data locality and making better use of the hardware's cache and parallel execution capabilities. However, the actual performance improvement would need to be verified through synthesis and testing on the target hardware.
