// Given the performance estimates, the primary target for optimization is the nested loop structure at `cnn-krnl.cpp:20` and `cnn-krnl.cpp:24`, which accounts for the majority of the accumulated cycles (90.9% for the outer loop and 89.7% for the inner loop). The high pipeline initiation interval (II=5) in the inner loop suggests that there is room for improvement in data access and computational efficiency. To address this, we can apply loop tiling to improve data locality and possibly reduce the initiation interval. Additionally, loop distribution can be applied to separate the accumulation operations on `s[j]` and `q[i]`, which may allow for more efficient pipelining and parallelization.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg_optimized(int m,int n,double A[124][116],double s[116],double q[124],double p[116],double r[124])
{
  int i, j, ii, jj;
  int TILE_SIZE_I = 62; // Assuming a tile size that fits well into local memory and cache
  int TILE_SIZE_J = 58; // Adjust based on cache size and experiment for best performance

  // Initialize 's' array
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    s[i] = ((double )0);
  }

  // Initialize 'q' array
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
    q[i] = 0.0;
  }

  // Apply loop tiling for improved data locality
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
  for (ii = 0; ii < 124; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
    for (jj = 0; jj < 116; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {
      
      // Apply loop distribution to separate the operations on 's' and 'q'
      // First operation on 's'
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
      for (i = ii; i < min(124, ii + TILE_SIZE_I); i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
        for (j = jj; j < min(116, jj + TILE_SIZE_J); j++) {
          s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
        }
      }

      // Second operation on 'q'
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
      for (i = ii; i < min(124, ii + TILE_SIZE_I); i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
        for (j = jj; j < min(116, jj + TILE_SIZE_J); j++) {
          q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to both `i` and `j` loops to improve cache utilization and data locality. This should help in reducing the memory access time for the arrays `A`, `r`, and `p`, which are accessed multiple times across iterations.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: Separates the updates to `s[j]` and `q[i]` into two distinct loops. This transformation is aimed at simplifying the loop body, which can help in achieving better pipelining and parallelization by the HLS tool. It also allows for more focused optimization on each operation.
// 
// 3. **Preservation of Original Pragmas**: The original pragmas for parallelization, pipelining, and tiling have been preserved and adapted to the transformed code structure. The `FACTOR=auto` directives are kept to let the HLS tool automatically determine the best factor for parallelization and tiling based on the transformed loop structure.
// 
// By applying these transformations, we aim to reduce the accumulated cycles and improve the cycles per call by enhancing data locality, reducing memory access delays, and enabling more efficient parallel execution. The exact improvement would need to be verified by synthesizing the transformed code and comparing the new performance estimates.
