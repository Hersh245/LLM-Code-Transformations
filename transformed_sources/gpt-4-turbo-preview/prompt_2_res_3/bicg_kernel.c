// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, and loop fusion. However, it's important to note that the original code already includes directives for parallelization, pipelining, and tiling, which are specific to the HLS tool being used (indicated by `#pragma ACCEL`). These directives suggest that the compiler should already optimize parallel execution and memory access patterns. Despite this, we can still explore manual code transformations for educational purposes, keeping in mind that the effectiveness of these transformations heavily depends on the specific HLS tool and target hardware architecture.
// 
// Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124])
{
    int i, j;

    // Initialize 's' array
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        s[i] = ((double)0);
    }

    // Loop distribution applied here to separate the operations on 's' and 'q'
    // This allows for more focused optimizations on each loop

    // First loop for updating 'q'
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        q[i] = 0.0;
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
        for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
            q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
        }
    }

    // Second loop for updating 's'
    // Loop permutation applied here to improve memory access pattern
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
        for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
            s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: The original loop that updates both `s` and `q` arrays is split into two separate loops. This allows each loop to be optimized independently, potentially improving the efficiency of memory access patterns and parallelization opportunities. Loop distribution is particularly useful when dealing with loops that perform multiple, independent operations.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: For the loop updating the `s` array, we permute the loop order. This transformation is applied to improve spatial locality and cache behavior, as it ensures that memory accesses to `A` and `s` are more sequential. Loop permutation is beneficial when accessing multi-dimensional arrays where the order of accesses can significantly impact performance due to cache hierarchies.
// 
// 3. **Maintaining HLS Pragmas**: All original HLS-specific pragmas (`#pragma ACCEL`) are kept intact. These pragmas provide hints to the HLS compiler for parallelization (`PARALLEL`), pipelining (`PIPELINE`), and tiling (`TILE`). The effectiveness of manual code transformations must be evaluated in conjunction with these pragmas, as the HLS tool uses them to make hardware-specific optimizations.
// 
// It's important to note that the effectiveness of these transformations depends on the target FPGA architecture and the specifics of the HLS toolchain. Additionally, thorough testing and performance evaluation are essential to ensure that the transformations lead to the desired performance improvements without introducing bugs.
