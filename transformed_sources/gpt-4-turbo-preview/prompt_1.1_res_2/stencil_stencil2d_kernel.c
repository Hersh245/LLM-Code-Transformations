// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void stencil(int orig[8192], int sol[8192], int filter[9]) {
  int r, c, k1, k2, temp, mul;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

  // Loop tiling transformation applied to the outer two loops
  // to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  int TILE_SIZE_R = 16; // Example tile size for 'r' dimension, adjust based on target architecture
  int TILE_SIZE_C = 16; // Example tile size for 'c' dimension, adjust based on target architecture
  
  stencil_label0:
  for (int rr = 0; rr < 126; rr += TILE_SIZE_R) {
    stencil_label1:
    for (int cc = 0; cc < 62; cc += TILE_SIZE_C) {
      
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
      
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
      
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
      stencil_label2:
      for (r = rr; r < rr + TILE_SIZE_R && r < 126; r++) {
        stencil_label3:
        for (c = cc; c < cc + TILE_SIZE_C && c < 62; c++) {
          temp = ((int)0);
          
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
          stencil_label4:
          for (k1 = 0; k1 < 3; k1++) {
            stencil_label5:
            for (k2 = 0; k2 < 3; k2++) {
              mul = filter[k1 * 3 + k2] * orig[(r + k1) * 64 + c + k2];
              temp += mul;
            }
          }
          sol[r * 64 + c] = temp;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling:** The outer two loops iterating over `r` and `c` have been tiled. This transformation divides the iteration space of these loops into smaller blocks or "tiles". This is beneficial for two main reasons:
//    - It can significantly improve cache locality by working on a smaller subset of the data that fits into the faster levels of cache, reducing memory bandwidth requirements.
//    - It enables more efficient parallel execution of the innermost computations, as each tile can be processed independently.
// 
//    The choice of tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_R` and `TILE_SIZE_C`) is crucial and should be based on the specific architecture's cache sizes and the available parallel execution resources. The values provided here are placeholders and should be tuned for the target architecture.
// 
// 2. **Maintaining Original Pragmas:** All original pragmas have been kept in place to ensure that the compiler's guidance for parallelization and pipelining is preserved. These pragmas hint at the compiler to automatically determine the best factors for parallel execution, pipelining, and tiling at different loop levels. The loop tiling transformation introduced new loop levels, and corresponding pragmas were added to these levels to ensure that the HLS tool can optimize these new loop structures effectively.
// 
// ### Rationale Behind Not Applying Other Transformations:
// 
// - **Loop Permutation:** The original loop order seems to be already optimal for accessing the `orig` array in a row-major order, which is typical for C arrays. Permuting the loops would not likely yield a significant benefit and could potentially harm data locality.
// - **Loop Distribution and Fusion:** The original code does not have multiple distinct computations within the loop body that could benefit from distribution or fusion without altering the algorithm's semantics.
// 
// These transformations aim to balance the trade-offs between parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization to achieve better performance on hardware accelerated platforms.
