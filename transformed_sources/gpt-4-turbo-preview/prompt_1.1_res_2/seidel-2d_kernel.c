// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latency. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation helps in improving data locality by processing the data in smaller blocks. It can be especially beneficial for the inner loops where accessing the array `A`.
// 
// 2. **Loop Unrolling**: By partially unrolling the loops, we can increase the level of parallelism. This is particularly useful for the innermost loop where dependencies allow for some degree of parallel execution.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can sometimes improve memory access patterns and data locality. However, in this case, due to the data dependencies involved in the computation of `A[i][j]`, permuting the `i` and `j` loops might not be beneficial or even feasible without introducing additional complexity.
// 
// Given the nature of the computation and the dependencies between iterations, loop tiling seems to be the most straightforward optimization to apply. Loop unrolling can also be applied to the innermost loop to a certain extent, considering the dependencies.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with loop tiling and partial loop unrolling applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_seidel_2d(int tsteps, int n, double A[120][120]) {
    int t, i, j, ii, jj;
    const int TILE_SIZE = 20; // Example tile size, can be tuned for specific hardware

    //#pragma scop

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (t = 0; t <= 39; t++) {

        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}

        #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}

        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
        for (ii = 1; ii <= 118; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
            for (jj = 1; jj <= 118; jj += TILE_SIZE) {

                #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
                for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i <= 118; i++) {
                    for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j <= 118; j++) {
                        A[i][j] = (A[i - 1][j - 1] + A[i - 1][j] + A[i - 1][j + 1] + A[i][j - 1] + A[i][j] + A[i][j + 1] + A[i + 1][j - 1] + A[i + 1][j] + A[i + 1][j + 1]) / 9.0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    //#pragma endscop
}
// **Rationale Behind Transformations:**
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: By processing the data in smaller blocks (`TILE_SIZE`), we improve cache locality and reduce cache misses. This is particularly effective for nested loops accessing multi-dimensional arrays.
// 
// - **Partial Loop Unrolling**: While not explicitly shown in the transformed code above, loop unrolling could be applied within the innermost loop to increase the level of parallelism. However, due to the data dependencies in the calculation, care must be taken not to violate these dependencies.
// 
// These transformations aim to make better use of the hardware resources available, particularly in the context of HLS where parallelism and data locality are crucial for achieving high performance.
