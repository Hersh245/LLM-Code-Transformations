// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax, int nx, int ny, double ex[60][80], double ey[60][80], double hz[60][80], double _fict_[40]) {
  int t, i, j;

  // Loop fusion for better data locality and reduced loop overhead
  // Combining all operations within a single time step iteration
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
    // Update ey[0][j] and ey[i][j] in a single loop to exploit spatial locality
    // Loop tiling is applied here for ey updates to improve cache efficiency
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto
    for (i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
        if (i == 0) {
          ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];
        } else {
          ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);
        }
      }
    }

    // Loop tiling for ex update to improve cache efficiency
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto
    for (i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 1; j < 80; j++) {
        ex[i][j] = ex[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]);
      }
    }

    // Loop tiling for hz update to improve cache efficiency
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto
    for (i = 0; i < 59; i++) {
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 0; j < 79; j++) {
        hz[i][j] = hz[i][j] - 0.7 * (ex[i][j + 1] - ex[i][j] + ey[i + 1][j] - ey[i][j]);
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: By combining operations within a single time step (`t`) iteration, we reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality. This means that data loaded into cache or registers for one operation can be reused efficiently by subsequent operations, reducing memory access latency and increasing cache efficiency.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling (Blocking)**: Applied to the `ey`, `ex`, and `hz` update loops to improve cache utilization. By working on smaller blocks of the arrays at a time, this transformation ensures that the working set of data fits into the cache, reducing cache misses and memory bandwidth requirements. This is particularly effective for nested loops accessing large arrays.
// 
// 3. **Parallelism**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto` annotations suggest to the HLS tool that it should automatically determine the optimal factor of parallelism for the loop iterations. This is crucial for exploiting the parallel processing capabilities of the target hardware (e.g., FPGAs), leading to significant speedups.
// 
// 4. **Pipeline Efficiency**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto` directive instructs the HLS tool to pipeline the loop iterations, allowing for multiple iterations to be executed in parallel at different stages of completion. This transformation is key to achieving high throughput, as it minimizes idle hardware resources and maximizes utilization.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is optimized for HLS, making it more suitable for efficient hardware implementation. The specific directives (e.g., `TILE FACTOR=auto`) leave the determination of the exact tiling size and parallelism factor to the HLS tool, leveraging its ability to analyze the code and hardware constraints to make optimal decisions.
