// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This is useful for improving data locality and access patterns. However, in this case, due to the nature of the operations (matrix-vector and vector updates), direct loop permutation might not yield significant benefits without changing the memory access patterns significantly.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique can be applied to break down the loops into smaller chunks, improving cache utilization and enabling more efficient parallel execution. We'll apply this to the matrix operations.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This can be used to separate independent operations within a loop, allowing them to be parallelized or pipelined more effectively. However, the given code has already well-separated concerns, so explicit distribution might not be necessary.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: This technique combines loops that have the same loop bounds and are independent, which can reduce the overhead of loop control. Given the structure of the provided code, there's limited scope for loop fusion without altering the algorithm's correctness.
// 
// Given the constraints and the structure of the provided code, the most beneficial transformation appears to be loop tiling for the matrix operations. However, since the pragma hints (`#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto`) are already suggesting automatic tiling, explicit tiling might only be necessary if we want to fine-tune the tiling factors beyond what the automatic tools provide.
// 
// Below is an example of how one might attempt to manually tile one of the loops, keeping in mind that the original pragmas suggest an intention to rely on automatic optimizations provided by the HLS tool. Note that manual tiling is typically done when the programmer has specific knowledge about the target architecture or when automatic optimizations are not sufficient.
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gemver(int n, double alpha, double beta, double A[120][120], double u1[120], double v1[120], double u2[120], double v2[120], double w[120], double x[120], double y[120], double z[120]) {
    int i, j, ii, jj;
    const int TILE_SIZE = 30; // Example tile size, this should be tuned based on the target architecture and problem size

    #pragma scop

    // Tiling for A update
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
            for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 120; i++) {
                for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 120; j++) {
                    A[i][j] += u1[i] * v1[j] + u2[i] * v2[j];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // The rest of the code remains unchanged, as the primary opportunity for optimization through tiling lies within the matrix operations.
    // Further optimizations would require a deeper understanding of the target architecture and the specific goals (e.g., latency vs. throughput optimization).

    #pragma endscop
}
// This example only tiles the first loop that updates matrix `A`, as it's the most straightforward candidate for tiling. The tile size (`TILE_SIZE`) is a crucial parameter that should be tuned based on the specific hardware and problem size. The other loops could potentially be tiled in a similar manner, but the benefits would need to be evaluated against the complexity and the specific hardware targets.
// 
// Keep in mind that the effectiveness of these transformations highly depends on the target architecture and the specific HLS toolchain being used. Automatic optimizations (`FACTOR=auto`) provided by the HLS tool might already perform similar or more suitable transformations based on the target hardware.
