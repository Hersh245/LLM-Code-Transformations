// To optimize the provided code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency. Here's a version of the code after applying loop tiling, loop permutation, and loop fusion where applicable. Note that the specific transformations and their effectiveness can depend on the target architecture and the HLS tool being used.

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is applied to both the column and row sweeps. It helps in improving data locality by working on smaller blocks of the arrays at a time, which can be more efficient due to better cache usage. The `TILE_SIZE` is chosen as a factor of the loop range for simplicity, but in practice, it should be tuned based on the target architecture's cache sizes and the data size of `double` type.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: This transformation is implicitly applied as part of loop tiling. By iterating over tiles and then within those tiles, we're effectively permuting the loop order. This can help in accessing memory in a more regular pattern, improving cache behavior.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion**: No explicit loop fusion is applied in this transformation as the original loops are already compact and deal with different data dependencies. However, in general, loop fusion can be considered to combine loops that have similar ranges and can benefit from being executed in a single loop body to reduce loop overhead and improve data locality.
// 
// 4. **Pragma Directives**: The original pragmas for pipeline, tile, and parallel are preserved and adapted to the transformed code structure. These directives hint to the HLS tool how to optimize the loops for parallel execution and pipelining. The `auto` factors and specific labels (`__PIPE__Lx`, `__TILE__Lx`, `__PARA__Lx`) are placeholders and should be adjusted based on the HLS tool's requirements and the specific optimization targets.
// 
// Remember, the effectiveness of these transformations can vary based on the specifics of the hardware target and the HLS toolchain used. It's often necessary to experiment with different transformations and tuning parameters to achieve the best performance.
