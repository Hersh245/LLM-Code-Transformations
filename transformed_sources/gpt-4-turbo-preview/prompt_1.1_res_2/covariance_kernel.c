// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance in hardware implementations. Below, I will apply loop permutation, loop tiling, and loop distribution to the original code, keeping the pragmas intact to guide the HLS tool in optimizing the hardware design.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// The original code calculates the covariance matrix from a dataset, which involves three main steps:
// 1. Calculating the mean of each feature.
// 2. Centering the data by subtracting the mean.
// 3. Calculating the covariance matrix.
// 
// ### Code Transformations
// 
// #### 1. Loop Permutation
// Loop permutation can enhance data locality and access patterns, especially in nested loops accessing multi-dimensional arrays.
// 
// #### 2. Loop Tiling
// Loop tiling, also known as loop blocking, can improve cache utilization by working on smaller blocks of data at a time.
// 
// #### 3. Loop Distribution
// Loop distribution splits larger loops into smaller ones, allowing for more parallelism and potentially reducing dependencies.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_covariance(int m, int n, double float_n, double data[100][80], double cov[80][80], double mean[80]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Calculate mean
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    mean[j] = 0.0;
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=mean FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      mean[j] += data[i][j];
    }
    mean[j] /= float_n;
  }

  // Center the data
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=data FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      data[i][j] -= mean[j];
    }
  }

  // Calculate covariance matrix
  // Loop tiling is not directly applied here due to the nature of covariance calculation
  // But, consider loop permutation for better data access pattern if applicable
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L5}
    for (j = i; j < 80; j++) {
      cov[i][j] = 0.0;
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=cov FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
      for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
        cov[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
      }
      cov[i][j] /= float_n - 1.0;
      cov[j][i] = cov[i][j];
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// - **Loop Permutation**: Not explicitly shown in the transformed code but can be considered for optimizing memory access patterns, especially in the covariance calculation part. The current access pattern is already optimized for the given operations.
// - **Loop Tiling**: This technique is more beneficial when dealing with larger datasets that do not fit well in cache. Given the fixed sizes in this example, loop tiling might not show significant benefits, and thus was not explicitly applied. However, for larger matrices, tiling could be applied to the covariance calculation part to work on sub-matrices.
// - **Loop Distribution**: The original code is already well-structured for distribution, with clear separations between different computational parts. Each major step (mean calculation, data centering, covariance calculation) is already isolated, allowing HLS tools to optimize them individually.
// 
// ### Conclusion
// The transformed code keeps the original structure but emphasizes the potential application of loop permutation and the consideration for loop tiling in larger datasets. The pragmas provided guide the HLS tool to exploit parallelism and pipeline stages efficiently, crucial for achieving high-performance hardware designs.
