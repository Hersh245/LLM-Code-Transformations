// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latencies. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: We distribute the second loop into two separate loops. This helps in isolating the reduction operation on `y[j]` from the computation of `tmp[i]`, potentially allowing for better optimization by the HLS tool.
// 
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: We can't apply loop fusion here as the loops are already in their optimal form for parallel execution.
// 
// 3. **Loop Tiling**: Not directly applicable here due to the nature of the computation. Tiling is more beneficial when there's a nested loop accessing a multi-dimensional array in a pattern that benefits from sub-blocking (to enhance data locality). However, the access pattern here doesn't lend itself easily to tiling due to the reduction operation on `y`.
// 
// 4. **Loop Unrolling**: This can be hinted at by the `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directive with `FACTOR=auto`. The HLS tool will decide the unroll factor. Explicit loop unrolling isn't shown but is implied through these pragmas.
// 
// Given these considerations, the main transformation applied here is loop distribution, which is already implicitly suggested by the separation of operations within the loop. The original code is already well-optimized for HLS with the use of pragmas indicating parallelism and pipeline directives. 
// 
// Here's the transformed code, which largely retains its original structure due to the reasons mentioned above:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m,int n,double A[116][124],double x[124],double y[124],double tmp[116])
{
  int i;
  int j;
  //#pragma scop
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) 
    y[i] = ((double )0);
  
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    tmp[i] = 0.0;
    
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
    }
  }
  
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
    }
  }
  //#pragma endscop
}
// Rationale behind not changing much:
// 
// - **Loop Distribution**: The original code effectively performs loop distribution by separating the computation of `tmp[i]` and the update of `y[j]` into distinct loops. However, they are kept within the same iteration space for `i`, which is optimal given the dependency on `tmp[i]` for the computation of `y[j]`.
// 
// - **Data Locality and Parallelism**: The pragmas used (`#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE`, `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL`) suggest to the HLS tool to exploit parallelism and pipeline stages where possible. The `FACTOR=auto` hints allow the HLS tool to automatically determine the optimal factor for parallelism and pipelining, which is often more efficient than manually specifying these factors without detailed profiling.
// 
// In summary, the original code is already structured in a way that is conducive to HLS optimizations, with explicit pragmas guiding the tool to exploit parallelism and pipelining. Direct loop transformations like tiling or fusion do not apply straightforwardly due to the nature of the computation and the existing optimizations.
