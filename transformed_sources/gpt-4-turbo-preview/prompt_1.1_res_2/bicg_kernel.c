// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations, we'll focus on improving parallelism, data locality, and reducing memory access latency. The transformations we'll apply include loop interchange (permutation), loop tiling, and loop distribution. These transformations aim to enhance the efficiency of the code when synthesized to hardware, such as FPGAs.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// The original code consists of two main loops. The first loop initializes the array `s`, and the second nested loop computes the values for arrays `q` and `s` using matrix `A` and vectors `p` and `r`. The pragma directives suggest an intention to parallelize and pipeline operations, but there's room for optimization, especially in terms of loop ordering and data access patterns.
// 
// ### Optimized Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg_optimized(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124]) {
    int i, j;
    double temp_s[116] = {0.0}; // Temporary array for s to ensure reduction is efficiently handled

    // Initialize q to zero
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        q[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // Loop interchange applied to improve data locality on 's' updates
    // Loop distribution to separate concerns between 's' and 'q' updates

    // Update 's' in a separate loop to exploit parallelism
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
        for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
            temp_s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Reduction to update 's' from 'temp_s'
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
        s[j] = temp_s[j];
    }

    // Update 'q' in a separate loop to exploit parallelism
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L3}
        for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
            q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Interchange**: We interchanged the loops for updating `s` to improve data locality. This way, each iteration of the outer loop focuses on a single element of `s`, reducing the number of times data needs to be fetched from memory.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: We separated the updates to `s` and `q` into different loops. This simplifies the loop bodies, making it easier for the HLS tool to optimize and parallelize the operations. It also allows us to apply different optimization strategies tailored to each loop.
// 
// 3. **Introduction of a Temporary Array (`temp_s`)**: To efficiently handle the reduction operation when updating `s`, we use a temporary array. This avoids potential dependencies and conflicts that could arise from trying to update `s` directly within the loop, enabling better parallelization.
// 
// 4. **Parallelism and Pipelining Pragmas**: We retained the original pragmas and adjusted their placement according to the transformed loop structure. These pragmas hint to the HLS tool how to parallelize loops and pipeline operations for better performance.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the optimized code is expected to exhibit improved parallelism, reduced memory access latency, and better utilization of hardware resources when synthesized using HLS for FPGA targets.
