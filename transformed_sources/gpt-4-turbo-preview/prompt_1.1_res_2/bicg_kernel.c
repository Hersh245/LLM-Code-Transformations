// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we need to consider the primary goals: improving parallelism, reducing memory access latency, and enhancing data reuse. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg_optimized(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124]) {
    int i, j;
    double temp_s[116] = {0.0}; // Temporary array for s to allow for parallel accumulation

    // Loop distribution applied to separate the operations on s and q
    // This allows for more focused optimization on each part

    // Initialize s with zeros - this loop is now redundant due to temp_s initialization
    // and can be removed to reduce the total number of iterations.
    /*
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        s[i] = ((double)0);
    }
    */

    // Optimized loop for calculating s
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
        for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
            temp_s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Copy the results from temp_s to s after accumulation
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        s[i] = temp_s[i];
    }

    // Optimized loop for calculating q
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        q[i] = 0.0; // Initialize q[i] here to avoid a separate loop

        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
        for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
            q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Temporary Array for `s`**: To enable parallel accumulation without race conditions, a temporary array `temp_s` is used. This allows each iteration of the loop to independently accumulate into `temp_s`, which is then copied back to `s` after all parallel operations are complete.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The original loop that updates both `s` and `q` within the same iteration is split into two separate loops. This separation allows for more focused optimization on each part and reduces the complexity within a single loop iteration, potentially improving parallelism and pipeline efficiency.
// 
// 3. **Removal of Redundant Initialization for `s`**: The original loop that initializes `s` with zeros is removed because `temp_s` is already initialized with zeros. This reduces unnecessary iterations and leverages static initialization to ensure all elements are zeroed before use.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: Not directly applied here, but by integrating the initialization of `q[i]` within the loop that computes its value, we effectively perform a minor fusion that reduces the need for a separate loop just for initialization.
// 
// 5. **Pragma Directives**: The original pragma directives are maintained and appropriately placed to guide the HLS tool in optimizing the loops. The `PIPELINE` pragma is used to suggest that iterations of the inner loop can be overlapped, while the `PARALLEL` pragma indicates potential parallel execution of loop iterations, subject to resource availability.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is better structured for HLS tools to exploit parallelism and pipeline execution, potentially leading to a more efficient hardware implementation.
