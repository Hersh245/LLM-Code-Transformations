// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC implementations. Below, I'll apply loop tiling and loop permutation, as these are the most relevant optimizations for the given code snippet. I'll maintain the original pragmas to guide the HLS tool in optimizing the kernel.

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling:** This transformation is applied to the outer loop (`loop_i`) to improve data locality. By processing a smaller subset of elements (tile) at a time, we can make more efficient use of the on-chip memory, reducing the need for frequent memory accesses to off-chip memory. This is particularly beneficial for FPGA implementations where memory bandwidth can be a limiting factor. The choice of `TILE_SIZE` should be based on the specific hardware constraints and the size of available on-chip memory.
// 
// 2. **Maintaining Original Pragmas:** The original pragmas (`PIPELINE`, `TILE`, `PARALLEL`) are kept to provide hints to the HLS tool for further optimizations. These pragmas suggest to the compiler to attempt automatic pipelining, tiling, and parallelization of the loops, respectively. The `auto` factor allows the HLS tool to determine the optimal factor based on the target hardware and the specific loop characteristics.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation:** Although not explicitly applied here, loop permutation could be considered if there were nested loops with different access patterns. In this code, the primary focus is on loop tiling to enhance data locality and parallelism.
// 
// By applying these transformations, we aim to improve the performance of the `md_kernel` function for HLS targets, taking advantage of hardware parallelism and optimizing memory access patterns.
