// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void stencil(int orig[8192], int sol[8192], int filter[9]) {
  int r, c, k1, k2, temp, mul;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  // Loop tiling is applied to both the 'r' and 'c' loops to improve data locality and cache utilization.
  // The tile sizes are chosen based on typical cache line sizes and should be tuned for the specific target architecture.
  int TILE_R = 16; // Example tile size for 'r', should be tuned
  int TILE_C = 16; // Example tile size for 'c', should be tuned

  for (int rr = 0; rr < 126; rr += TILE_R) {
    for (int cc = 0; cc < 62; cc += TILE_C) {

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
      
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
      
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
      for (r = rr; r < rr + TILE_R && r < 126; r++) {
        for (c = cc; c < cc + TILE_C && c < 62; c++) {
          temp = 0;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
          for (k1 = 0; k1 < 3; k1++) {
            for (k2 = 0; k2 < 3; k2++) {
              mul = filter[k1 * 3 + k2] * orig[(r + k1) * 64 + c + k2];
              temp += mul;
            }
          }
          sol[r * 64 + c] = temp;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling for `r` and `c` Loops**: This transformation improves data locality by working on smaller, contiguous blocks of the input and output arrays that are more likely to fit into the cache. This reduces the number of cache misses and can significantly speed up memory-bound operations. The tile sizes (`TILE_R` and `TILE_C`) are parameters that should be tuned based on the specific architecture's cache size and line size to find the optimal balance between locality and overhead.
// 
// 2. **Maintaining Pragmas**: The original pragmas for pipeline, tile, and parallel factors are maintained and applied at appropriate levels to ensure that the compiler can still apply automatic optimizations based on these hints. Specifically:
//    - The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directive is applied to the outermost loop where tiling is applied and also maintained within the inner loops to encourage the compiler to pipeline these loops for faster execution.
//    - The `#pragma ACCEL TILE` and `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directives are similarly applied to encourage the compiler to automatically determine the best tiling factors and parallel execution factors based on the transformed loop structure.
// 
// ### Conclusion:
// 
// The transformed code aims to improve the performance of the stencil computation by enhancing data locality through loop tiling and maintaining compiler directives for pipeline and parallel optimizations. The exact benefits of these transformations would need to be evaluated through synthesis and testing on the target FPGA hardware, with further tuning of tile sizes and possibly exploring additional optimizations such as loop unrolling for the innermost loops.
