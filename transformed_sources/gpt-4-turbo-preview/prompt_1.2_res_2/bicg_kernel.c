// To optimize the provided C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: We distribute the inner loop to separate the accumulation operations for `s[j]` and `q[i]`. This can help in improving the parallelism as each operation can be executed independently.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: For the loop iterating over `j`, we can apply loop tiling to improve cache locality. This is especially useful when dealing with large matrices, as it ensures that a smaller, more manageable block of the matrix is loaded into the cache to be worked on.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: We might consider permuting the loops to ensure that the innermost loop has the highest potential for parallel execution. However, in this specific case, due to the nature of the operations (reduction for `s[j]` and accumulation for `q[i]`), loop permutation might not offer significant benefits without changing the algorithm's semantics.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg_optimized(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124]) {
    int i, j, ii, jj;
    const int TILE_SIZE = 32; // Example tile size, adjust based on target architecture and memory bandwidth

    // Initialize s
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        s[i] = ((double)0);
    }

    // Initialize q
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        q[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // Loop distribution applied here to separate operations on s and q
    // Loop tiling applied to the operation on s
    for (ii = 0; ii < 124; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
        for (jj = 0; jj < 116; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
            #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
            for (i = ii; i < min(124, ii + TILE_SIZE); i++) {
                #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
                for (j = jj; j < min(116, jj + TILE_SIZE); j++) {
                    s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Separate loop for q to allow for independent optimization
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
        for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
            q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
        }
    }
}
// **Rationale Behind Transformations:**
// 
// - **Loop Distribution**: This transformation was applied to separate the updates to `s[j]` and `q[i]`. It allows for more focused optimization on each part and can help in reducing dependencies between different parts of the loop body.
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the loop iterating over `j` when updating `s[j]`, it improves data locality by working on smaller blocks of the matrix `A` at a time. This can significantly reduce cache misses and improve overall performance.
// 
// - **Loop Permutation**: Although not directly applied in the transformed code (due to the nature of the operations), loop permutation is a valuable optimization technique in scenarios where reordering loops can lead to better parallelism or data locality.
// 
// These transformations aim to make the code more amenable to parallel execution and efficient memory access patterns, which are crucial for achieving high performance in HLS-targeted applications.
