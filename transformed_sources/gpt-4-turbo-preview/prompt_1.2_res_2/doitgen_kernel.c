// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve data locality, parallelism, and reduce memory access latency. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Interchange**: This involves swapping the loops to improve data locality. However, in this specific case, the most inner loop depends on the calculation of `sum[p]` which is then used to update `A[r][q][p]`. The current loop order seems to be optimal for data locality as it computes all necessary `sum[p]` before updating `A[r][q][p]`. Thus, we might not perform loop interchange here.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique breaks down loops into smaller blocks, improving cache utilization. However, the pragmas `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto` suggest that the tiling factor is automatically determined by the HLS tool. Explicit manual tiling might not be necessary unless we identify a specific performance bottleneck that the automatic tiling does not address.
// 
// 3. **Loop Unrolling**: This is implicitly suggested by the `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto` which aims at parallelizing loop iterations. Manual loop unrolling might not be explicitly required unless for very specific optimizations beyond the scope of this transformation.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: This technique combines two separate loops into one if they share the same loop index and bounds, reducing the overhead of loop control. However, in this code, the loops serve different purposes (calculation of `sum[p]` and updating `A[r][q][p]`), and fusing them would not be straightforward without altering the logic of the program.
// 
// Given the above considerations, the most significant transformation we can apply while respecting the original code structure and pragmas is to ensure that the code is clean and that the pragmas are correctly placed for the HLS tool to do its job effectively. Since the original code is already structured with HLS optimizations in mind (using `#pragma ACCEL` directives), major manual transformations might not significantly improve the code beyond what the HLS tool can automatically do.
// 
// Here's the code with comments on optimization pragmas:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(int nr, int nq, int np, double A[25][20][30], double C4[30][30], double sum[30]) {
    int r, q, p, s;

    // Loop tiling and pipeline pragmas are already specified, suggesting that
    // the HLS tool will automatically optimize these loops.
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto
    for (r = 0; r < 25; r++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
        #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto
        for (q = 0; q < 20; q++) {
            #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
            #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto
            for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
                sum[p] = 0.0;
                for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
                    sum[p] += A[r][q][s] * C4[s][p];
                }
            }
            for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
                A[r][q][p] = sum[p];
            }
        }
    }
}
// In this code, the pragmas are strategically placed to suggest to the HLS tool where to focus its optimization efforts, such as pipelining and tiling. The `auto` keyword indicates that the HLS tool should automatically determine the best factor for tiling and the best strategy for pipelining, which is often the most practical approach for complex kernels without a deep manual analysis of the potential bottlenecks.
