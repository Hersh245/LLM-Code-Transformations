// Optimizing the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) involves applying various loop transformations to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This can be applied to interchange the loops to improve data locality or to meet the prerequisites of other optimizations like loop tiling.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique breaks down loops into smaller blocks, improving cache utilization and enabling more effective parallel execution.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This separates independent computations within a loop, allowing them to be parallelized or optimized separately.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: This combines two adjacent loops that have the same loop bounds into a single loop, reducing loop overhead and improving data locality.
// 
// Given the original code, we'll focus on applying loop tiling for the matrix operations and loop fusion where applicable. However, due to the nature of the operations (matrix addition and matrix-vector multiplication), there's limited scope for loop fusion without altering the algorithm's behavior. Loop permutation will be considered for optimizing memory access patterns.

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// - **Loop Tiling on A[i][j] and w[i] updates**: Improves cache locality by working on smaller sub-matrices or sub-arrays at a time. This is particularly effective for hardware with limited on-chip memory.
//   
// - **Loop Interchange on x[i] update**: Although not explicitly shown as a transformation, reordering the loops for the `x[i]` update (if dependencies allow) could improve memory access patterns. However, due to the nature of the operation (which resembles a matrix transpose operation), care must be taken to ensure that memory access patterns are indeed optimized.
// 
// - **Loop Fusion**: Not directly applied here due to the nature of operations, which don't present clear opportunities for fusion without changing the algorithm's semantics.
// 
// - **Parallel Pragmas**: Retained from the original code to hint at potential parallelism. The `FACTOR=auto` and other directives like `reduction` are crucial for informing the HLS tool about the intended parallel execution and data reduction patterns.
// 
// These transformations aim to make the code more amenable to parallel execution and efficient memory use, which are key for performance on many hardware architectures targeted by HLS.
