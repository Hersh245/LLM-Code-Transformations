// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Below, I'll apply loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, and potentially loop fusion, keeping in mind the original pragmas that hint at parallelism and pipelining opportunities.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// The original code iterates over a 2D grid to update electromagnetic fields in a FDTD (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) simulation. It uses pragmas to hint at optimization opportunities for an HLS tool, such as pipelining loops and parallel execution.
// 
// ### Optimized Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax, int nx, int ny, double ex[60][80], double ey[60][80], double hz[60][80], double _fict_[40]) {
    int t, i, j;

    // Loop tiling parameters (assuming these are optimal after experimentation)
    const int TILE_I = 8;
    const int TILE_J = 16;

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
        // Update ey: First row special case
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
        for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
            ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];
        }

        // Loop tiling for ey update
        for (i = 1; i < 60; i += TILE_I) {
            for (j = 0; j < 80; j += TILE_J) {
                #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
                for (int ii = i; ii < i + TILE_I && ii < 60; ii++) {
                    for (int jj = j; jj < j + TILE_J && jj < 80; jj++) {
                        ey[ii][jj] = ey[ii][jj] - 0.5 * (hz[ii][jj] - hz[ii - 1][jj]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Loop tiling for ex update
        for (i = 0; i < 60; i += TILE_I) {
            for (j = 1; j < 80; j += TILE_J) {
                #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
                for (int ii = i; ii < i + TILE_I && ii < 60; ii++) {
                    for (int jj = j; jj < j + TILE_J && jj < 80; jj++) {
                        ex[ii][jj] = ex[ii][jj] - 0.5 * (hz[ii][jj] - hz[ii][jj - 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Loop tiling for hz update
        for (i = 0; i < 59; i += TILE_I) {
            for (j = 0; j < 79; j += TILE_J) {
                #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
                for (int ii = i; ii < i + TILE_I && ii < 59; ii++) {
                    for (int jj = j; jj < j + TILE_J && jj < 79; jj++) {
                        hz[ii][jj] = hz[ii][jj] - 0.7 * (ex[ii][jj + 1] - ex[ii][jj] + ey[ii + 1][jj] - ey[ii][jj]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling:** Applied to the `i` and `j` loops for updating `ey`, `ex`, and `hz` arrays. This transformation aims to improve data locality by working on smaller sub-blocks of the data array, which can be more efficiently cached. The tile sizes (`TILE_I` and `TILE_J`) are parameters that should be tuned based on the specific hardware characteristics and the size of the on-chip memory.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation:** Not explicitly applied here as the original loop order seems optimal for memory access patterns (i.e., accessing array elements in a row-major order). However, loop tiling inherently involves permuting loops by introducing nested tiled loops.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution:** Not explicitly needed in this transformation as the original code structure and the transformations applied did not create opportunities for further distribution. Each major step (updating `ey`, `ex`, and `hz`) is already separated, and further distribution would not benefit the algorithm.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion:** Not applied because the original code does not have adjacent loops operating on disjoint data sets that could be merged to reduce loop overhead or improve data locality. Each major computation step is distinct and requires its own loop structure.
// 
// 5. **Pragma Directives:** Kept and adapted to the transformed code structure. The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto` and `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto` directives are used to hint at the HLS tool for potential pipelining and parallel execution within the transformed loop nests. The specific parameters and usage of these pragmas would depend on the HLS tool's capabilities and the target hardware architecture.
// 
// These transformations aim to make the code more amenable to high-level synthesis optimizations, potentially leading to better performance on hardware accelerators.
