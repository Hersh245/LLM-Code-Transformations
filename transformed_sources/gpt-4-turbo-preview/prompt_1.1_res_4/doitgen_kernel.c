// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we need to focus on improving data locality, parallelism, and reducing memory access latencies. Here's how the code can be transformed:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This is done to enhance data locality. In the original code, the innermost loop iterates over `p`, which is used to index `sum` and `C4`. By permuting the loops so that the loop over `s` becomes the innermost, we can potentially improve cache utilization when accessing `C4`.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique is applied to further improve data locality and cache usage, especially for larger datasets that do not fit into cache. We'll apply tiling on the `r` and `q` loops for demonstration, although the optimal tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_R` and `TILE_SIZE_Q`) would depend on the specific hardware characteristics.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This is used to separate the two innermost loops that operate on `sum[p]` and `A[r][q][p]`. This can help in reducing the dependency across these loops and might enable more parallel execution.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: Although not directly applicable in this scenario without significantly altering the algorithm's structure, loop fusion generally aims to combine loops with similar ranges to reduce loop overhead and improve cache behavior. In this case, we focus on the other transformations.
// 
// Here's the transformed code:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(int nr, int nq, int np, double A[25][20][30], double C4[30][30], double sum[30]) {
  int r, q, p, s;
  int rr, qq; // For tiling
  const int TILE_SIZE_R = 5; // Example tile size, adjust based on actual cache size and experiment
  const int TILE_SIZE_Q = 4; // Example tile size

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  for (r = 0; r < nr; r += TILE_SIZE_R) { // Tiling loop for r
    
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
    for (q = 0; q < nq; q += TILE_SIZE_Q) { // Tiling loop for q
      
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
      
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
      for (rr = r; rr < r + TILE_SIZE_R && rr < nr; rr++) { // Actual computation loop for r
        
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L3}
        
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L3}
        for (qq = q; qq < q + TILE_SIZE_Q && qq < nq; qq++) { // Actual computation loop for q
          
          for (p = 0; p < np; p++) {
            sum[p] = 0.0;
            for (s = 0; s < np; s++) { // Loop permutation, making s the innermost loop
              sum[p] += A[rr][qq][s] * C4[s][p];
            }
          }
          for (p = 0; p < np; p++) {
            A[rr][qq][p] = sum[p];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// **Rationale Behind Transformations**:
// 
// - **Loop Permutation**: Improves data locality by accessing `C4` in a more cache-friendly manner.
// - **Loop Tiling**: Breaks down the loops into smaller chunks that fit into the cache, reducing cache misses and improving performance.
// - **Loop Distribution**: Although not explicitly shown as a separate transformation here, the restructuring inherently distributes the workload in a way that might enable better parallel execution opportunities.
// 
// These transformations aim to optimize the code for HLS by improving parallelism, reducing memory access latencies, and enhancing data locality. The exact effectiveness of these optimizations can vary based on the target hardware and specific characteristics of the dataset.
