// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we'll apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency. We'll focus on loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, and loop fusion where applicable. Note that the original pragma directives are designed for FPGA acceleration and suggest that the compiler should automatically handle pipeline, tiling, and parallelization optimizations. However, we'll still discuss potential manual optimizations for educational purposes.
// 
// ### Original Code Review
// 
// The original code calculates the correlation matrix for a dataset. It involves:
// 1. Calculating the mean of each column.
// 2. Calculating the standard deviation of each column.
// 3. Normalizing the data by centering and scaling.
// 4. Calculating the correlation matrix.
// 
// ### Optimizations
// 
// #### 1. Loop Fusion for Mean and Standard Deviation Calculation
// We can combine the calculation of mean and standard deviation into a single loop to reduce the number of passes over the data. This reduces memory access latency and improves cache utilization.
// 
// #### 2. Loop Tiling for Correlation Matrix Calculation
// Loop tiling can be applied to the correlation matrix calculation to improve cache locality. However, given the relatively small size (80x80), the benefit might be limited, and the original code does not show a clear opportunity for tiling due to its simplicity. We'll focus on other optimizations.
// 
// #### 3. Loop Permutation for Data Normalization
// Loop permutation might not directly apply here since the operations inside loops are relatively simple and there's no evident nested loop with a better iteration order for memory access patterns in the normalization step.
// 
// #### 4. Parallelization and Pipelining Directives
// The original code already includes pragmas for parallelization and pipelining. We'll ensure that our transformations do not interfere with these optimizations.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
// 
// Given the considerations above, here's how the code could be transformed, focusing on loop fusion for mean and standard deviation calculation:
#include <math.h>
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_correlation(double float_n, double data[100][80], double corr[80][80], double mean[80], double stddev[80]) {
    int i, j, k;
    double eps = 0.1;
    double sum[80] = {0.0}, sum_sq[80] = {0.0};

    // Combined loop for mean and standard deviation calculation
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            sum[j] += data[i][j];
            sum_sq[j] += pow(data[i][j], 2);
        }
        mean[j] = sum[j] / float_n;
        stddev[j] = sqrt((sum_sq[j] / float_n) - pow(mean[j], 2));
        stddev[j] = (stddev[j] <= eps ? 1.0 : stddev[j]);
    }

    // Data normalization
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
        for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
            data[i][j] = (data[i][j] - mean[j]) / (sqrt(float_n) * stddev[j]);
        }
    }

    // Correlation matrix calculation
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (i = 0; i < 80 - 1; i++) {
        corr[i][i] = 1.0;
        for (j = i + 1; j < 80; j++) {
            corr[i][j] = 0.0;
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
            for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
                corr[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
            }
            corr[j][i] = corr[i][j];
        }
    }
    corr[80 - 1][80 - 1] = 1.0;
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// - **Loop Fusion for Mean and Standard Deviation**: This reduces the number of passes over the data, improving cache efficiency and reducing execution time.
// - **Maintaining Parallelization and Pipelining Directives**: These directives are crucial for FPGA acceleration. The transformations were made with an effort to keep these optimizations effective.
// 
// This transformed code aims to maintain the original intent and optimizations while improving efficiency through loop fusion. Other transformations like loop tiling or permutation were considered but are not directly applied due to the structure of the code and the nature of the operations.
