// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply various code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gemver(int n,double alpha,double beta,double A[120][120],double u1[120],double v1[120],double u2[120],double v2[120],double w[120],double x[120],double y[120],double z[120])
{
  int i, j, ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 30; // Example tile size, can be adjusted based on the target architecture's resources

#pragma scop

  // Loop tiling for the first loop nest to improve data locality and enable parallel execution of tiles
  // This transformation divides the computation into smaller chunks (tiles), which can be more efficiently loaded into the on-chip memory
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (i = ii; i < ((ii + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (ii + TILE_SIZE) : 120); i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=A FACTOR=auto
        for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (jj + TILE_SIZE) : 120); j++) {
          A[i][j] += u1[i] * v1[j] + u2[i] * v2[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Loop permutation for the second loop nest to change the loop order for better memory access patterns
  // This transformation aims to access memory in a more sequential manner, which is typically more efficient
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (j = 0; j < 120; j++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
    for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=x FACTOR=auto
      x[i] += beta * A[j][i] * y[j];
    }
  }

  // The third loop nest is already optimal in terms of parallelism and does not benefit from tiling or permutation
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=x FACTOR=auto
  for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
    x[i] += z[i];
  }

  // Loop tiling for the fourth loop nest similar to the first loop nest
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
    for (i = ii; i < ((ii + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (ii + TILE_SIZE) : 120); i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=w FACTOR=auto
      for (j = 0; j < 120; j++) {
        w[i] += alpha * A[i][j] * x[j];
      }
    }
  }

#pragma endscop
}
// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the first and fourth loop nests to break down the computation into smaller blocks or "tiles". This improves data locality by making efficient use of the cache or on-chip memory, which is crucial for performance on hardware accelerators. It also opens up opportunities for parallel execution of independent tiles.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Applied to the second loop nest to change the order of the loops. By iterating over `j` before `i`, we aim to access the array `A` in a more sequential manner (assuming row-major order), which can lead to better memory access patterns and cache utilization.
// 
// 3. **Parallel Pragmas**: Retained and adjusted to align with the transformed loop structures. These pragmas hint at the compiler to explore parallel execution of the loops, either by unrolling or by exploiting hardware parallelism capabilities, such as multiple processing elements.
// 
// 4. **Reduction Pragmas**: These are crucial for ensuring that parallel reductions (e.g., summing up values across iterations) are correctly handled in a parallel context, preserving the semantics of the original code.
// 
// By applying these transformations, we aim to enhance the performance of the `kernel_gemver` function when synthesized to hardware, taking advantage of parallelism, efficient memory access, and reduced latency.
