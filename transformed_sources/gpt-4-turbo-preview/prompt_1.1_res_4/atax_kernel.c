// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m, int n, double A[116][124], double x[124], double y[124], double tmp[116]) {
  int i, j;

  // Initialize y to 0
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++)
    y[i] = ((double)0);

  // Loop tiling can improve data locality and enable more effective use of on-chip memory.
  // However, given the dimensions and the nature of operations, loop tiling might not be directly applicable here without increasing complexity.
  // Instead, we focus on other optimizations.

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

  // Loop distribution applied to separate the reduction operations.
  // This transformation allows us to focus on optimizing each loop individually.
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    tmp[i] = 0.0;

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
    }
  }

  // The second loop is now independent and can be optimized separately.
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
    }
  }

  // Loop fusion could be considered to merge loops that have the same loop bounds and are independent,
  // but in this case, the original loops are inherently dependent due to the reduction operations.
  // Therefore, loop fusion is not applied.
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: The original code computes `tmp[i]` and updates `y[j]` within the same loop. By distributing the loops, we separate concerns, making it clearer to apply parallelization and reduction optimizations. This separation also makes it easier to reason about memory access patterns and dependencies.
// 
// 2. **Parallelization Pragmas**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` with `reduction` is used to explicitly inform the HLS tool that these loops can be parallelized, specifying that a reduction operation is being performed. The `FACTOR=auto` allows the HLS tool to automatically determine the optimal factor for parallelization, considering the available resources and the specific operation's requirements.
// 
// 3. **Pipeline Pragma**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` is used to enable loop pipelining, a critical optimization for HLS that overlaps loop iterations to improve throughput. The `auto` option lets the HLS tool choose the best way to pipeline the operations.
// 
// 4. **Tile Pragma**: Although the `#pragma ACCEL TILE` is included, loop tiling (blocking) is more effective when there are nested loops with large iteration spaces that can benefit from being broken down into smaller chunks to improve cache utilization. In this specific code, given the fixed and relatively small dimensions of the matrices, the benefit might be limited, but the pragma is kept for completeness and to allow the HLS tool to explore tiling if it finds it beneficial based on the target architecture.
// 
// By applying these transformations and optimizations, the code is better structured for HLS tools to exploit parallelism and optimize memory access patterns, leading to potentially higher performance on hardware accelerators.
