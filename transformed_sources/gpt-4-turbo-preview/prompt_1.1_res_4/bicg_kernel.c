// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124]) {
    int i, j;

    // Initialize s[i] to 0.0
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        s[i] = ((double)0);
    }

    // Initialize q[i] to 0.0 in a separate loop to allow for parallel execution
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        q[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // Loop distribution applied to separate the updates to s and q, allowing for more efficient pipelining and parallelization
    // Update s[j]
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
        for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
            s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Update q[i]
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
        for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
            q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Separate Initialization Loops**: The initialization of `s[i]` and `q[i]` are kept in separate loops to allow for parallel execution. This ensures that the initialization does not become a bottleneck and can be executed concurrently, improving the overall execution time.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The original loop that updates both `s[j]` and `q[i]` has been distributed into two separate loops. This transformation is beneficial because it allows each loop to be optimized independently. For instance, it enables better pipelining and parallel execution strategies for each loop, as the dependencies between updates to `s` and `q` are removed.
// 
// 3. **Pipelining and Parallelization**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` and `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directives are used to hint at the HLS tool to pipeline these loops and execute iterations in parallel where possible. This is crucial for achieving high throughput, as it minimizes idle cycles in the hardware implementation.
// 
// 4. **Reduction Pattern**: The reduction pattern (summing up values to `s[j]` and `q[i]`) is explicitly parallelized, allowing the HLS tool to implement an efficient reduction circuit. This is indicated by the `reduction` keyword in the pragma.
// 
// 5. **No Loop Tiling**: Loop tiling was not applied in this transformation as the primary focus was on improving parallelism and pipeline efficiency. Loop tiling could be considered in scenarios where memory bandwidth or cache efficiency is a bottleneck, but it requires careful consideration of the target architecture's memory hierarchy.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is better structured for HLS tools to exploit parallelism and pipeline operations, leading to a potentially more efficient hardware implementation.
