// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gemver(int n,double alpha,double beta,double A[120][120],double u1[120],double v1[120],double u2[120],double v2[120],double w[120],double x[120],double y[120],double z[120])
{
  int i;
  int j;
  int ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 30; // Example tile size, can be tuned for specific hardware
  
#pragma scop
  
  // Transformation 1: Loop tiling for the first loop nest to improve data locality and enable parallel execution
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto
  for (ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (i = ii; i < ((ii + TILE_SIZE) > 120 ? 120 : (ii + TILE_SIZE)); i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=A FACTOR=auto
        for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_SIZE) > 120 ? 120 : (jj + TILE_SIZE)); j++) {
          A[i][j] += u1[i] * v1[j] + u2[i] * v2[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Transformation 2: Loop permutation in the second loop nest to improve memory access pattern
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto
  for (j = 0; j < 120; j++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
    for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=x FACTOR=auto
      x[i] += beta * A[j][i] * y[j];
    }
  }
  
  // No transformation is applied here as it's already optimal for parallel execution
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=x FACTOR=auto
  for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
    x[i] += z[i];
  }
  
  // Transformation 3: Loop tiling for the third loop nest similar to the first loop nest
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto
  for (ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (i = ii; i < ((ii + TILE_SIZE) > 120 ? 120 : (ii + TILE_SIZE)); i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=w FACTOR=auto
        for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_SIZE) > 120 ? 120 : (jj + TILE_SIZE)); j++) {
          w[i] += alpha * A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }

// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the first and third loop nests to improve data locality. By working on smaller sub-matrices (tiles) at a time, this transformation helps to ensure that the data used by the computation fits into the cache, reducing memory access times and improving overall performance. It also enables parallel execution of operations within tiles.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Applied to the second loop nest to change the memory access pattern. By accessing `A[j][i]` in a row-major order (considering C uses row-major order for multi-dimensional arrays), this transformation aims to improve cache utilization and reduce cache misses.
// 
// 3. **Parallelism**: The use of `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` with a reduction clause and an auto factor in various parts of the code is intended to hint the HLS tool to exploit parallelism. The reduction operations on `A`, `x`, and `w` are explicitly marked to ensure that the HLS tool can safely parallelize these operations without violating data dependencies.
// 
// 4. **Pipeline and Tile Pragmas**: These pragmas are used to suggest that the HLS tool should attempt to pipeline the operations and automatically determine the best tiling factor for the loop nests. Pipelining helps to execute multiple iterations of a loop or multiple loop nests concurrently, further improving the throughput of the design.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is better suited for HLS targeting FPGA or ASIC, with improved parallelism, reduced memory access latency, and better utilization of on-chip resources.
