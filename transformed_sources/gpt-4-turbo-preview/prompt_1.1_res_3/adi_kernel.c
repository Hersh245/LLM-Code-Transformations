// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The main goals of these transformations are to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency. Here's how we can approach it:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation helps to improve cache locality by processing a small block of data at a time. However, due to the nature of the algorithm (Alternating Direction Implicit method), and the already small problem size (60x60), tiling might not offer significant benefits without further knowledge of the target architecture's memory hierarchy. For HLS, focusing on parallelism and pipelining is more crucial.
// 
// 2. **Loop Unrolling (Parallelism)**: This transformation is applied to enhance parallel execution. The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directive suggests that the compiler attempts to automatically unroll loops to exploit parallelism. Specifying a factor or allowing the compiler to choose ("auto") can significantly impact the performance, depending on the hardware capabilities.
// 
// 3. **Loop Pipelining**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directive is used to enable loop pipelining, a technique that allows iterations of a loop to overlap, thus potentially executing in parallel. This is crucial for HLS as it can significantly reduce the latency of loop execution.
// 
// Given the structure of the provided code, direct loop tiling might not be straightforward without altering the algorithm's correctness due to dependencies in the computation of `p` and `q`. However, ensuring that the compiler is aware of opportunities for parallelism and pipelining is key.
// 
// Below is the optimized code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

  double DY = 1.0 / 60;
  double DT = 1.0 / 40;
  double B1 = 2.0;
  double B2 = 1.0;
  double mul1 = B1 * DT / (DX * DX);
  double mul2 = B2 * DT / (DY * DY);
  double a = -mul1 / 2.0;
  double b = 1.0 + mul1;
  double c = a;
  double d = -mul2 / 2.0;
  double e = 1.0 + mul2;
  double f = d;

// **Rationale Behind Transformations:**
// 
// - **Loop Pipelining and Parallelism**: These are the primary transformations applied. They instruct the HLS tool to look for opportunities to execute loop iterations in parallel or in an overlapped manner, which is particularly beneficial on FPGAs where operations can be highly parallelized.
//   
// - **Loop Tiling**: Not applied due to the small problem size and potential dependency issues. Tiling is more beneficial when working with larger datasets or when memory bandwidth is a bottleneck.
// 
// - **Loop Unrolling (Implicitly with Parallelism)**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directive can lead to loop unrolling by the HLS tool, depending on the specified factor or the tool's automatic decision-making.
// 
// This approach focuses on maximizing the hardware's capability to execute operations in parallel, which is a key advantage of FPGAs and similar architectures targeted by HLS.
