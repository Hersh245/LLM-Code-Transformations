// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. Here, we'll focus on loop tiling, loop distribution, and loop permutation. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance in hardware implementations.
// 
// ### Original Code Snippet Overview
// The original code performs two main operations within a nested loop structure:
// 1. Accumulating into `s[j]` based on the product of `r[i]` and `A[i][j]`.
// 2. Accumulating into `q[i]` based on the product of `A[i][j]` and `p[j]`.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: We'll distribute the inner loop into two separate loops. This transformation is beneficial for separating concerns, potentially allowing for more parallelism and better pipelining opportunities.
//    
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: We apply loop tiling to both the outer and the newly distributed inner loops to improve data locality and enable parallel execution of chunks of the loops.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Depending on the access patterns, we might consider permuting the loops to ensure that the data is accessed in a more cache-friendly manner. However, in this case, due to the nature of the operations (dot product-like operations), loop permutation might not offer significant benefits without changing the data layout. Thus, we focus on the first two transformations.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg_optimized(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124]) {
    int i, j;
    // Initialize s
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        s[i] = ((double)0);
    }

    // Initialize q
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        q[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // Tile size (can be tuned for specific hardware)
    int TILE_SIZE = 32; // Example tile size, adjust based on hardware and problem size

    // Loop tiling and distribution applied
    for (int ii = 0; ii < 124; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (int jj = 0; jj < 116; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
            
            #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
            for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 124; i++) {
                double q_temp = 0.0;
                for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 116; j++) {
                    s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
                    q_temp += A[i][j] * p[j];
                }
                q[i] += q_temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// - **Loop Distribution**: Separating the accumulation into `s[j]` and `q[i]` allows each operation to be optimized independently. However, to maintain the original program's semantics and due to their dependent nature, we carefully manage the accumulation into `q[i]` within the same iteration space.
//   
// - **Loop Tiling**: By introducing tiling, we aim to improve cache utilization and reduce memory access latency. The tile size (`TILE_SIZE`) is a parameter that should be tuned based on the specific hardware characteristics and problem size. Tiling also offers opportunities for parallel execution of independent tiles.
// 
// - **Loop Fusion**: While not explicitly applied here due to the initial structure of the code, loop fusion could be considered in scenarios where multiple loops iterate over the same range and perform independent operations that could benefit from being performed in a single pass to improve data locality.
// 
// These transformations aim to enhance the performance of the code when synthesized to hardware, leveraging parallelism, and improving data access patterns for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) environments.
