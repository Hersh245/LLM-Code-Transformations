// To optimize the given code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void stencil(int orig[8192], int sol[8192], int filter[9]) {
  int r, c, k1, k2, temp, mul;

  // Loop tiling for the outer loops to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // Tiling factors are chosen based on typical FPGA on-chip memory sizes and the specific requirements of the algorithm.
  int TILE_R = 16; // Tile size for rows, chosen for demonstration. Optimal size depends on FPGA.
  int TILE_C = 16; // Tile size for columns, chosen for demonstration. Optimal size depends on FPGA.

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (int rt = 0; rt < 128 - 2; rt += TILE_R) {
    for (int ct = 0; ct < 64 - 2; ct += TILE_C) {

      // Loop permutation swaps the order of the tiled loops and the computation loops to improve memory access patterns.
      // This can enhance parallelism and reduce memory access latency.
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
      for (r = rt; r < rt + TILE_R && r < 128 - 2; ++r) {
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
        for (c = ct; c < ct + TILE_C && c < 64 - 2; ++c) {
          temp = 0;

          // Inner loops remain unchanged as they are already optimal for accessing the filter and original array elements.
          for (k1 = 0; k1 < 3; k1++) {
            for (k2 = 0; k2 < 3; k2++) {
              mul = filter[k1 * 3 + k2] * orig[(r + k1) * 64 + c + k2];
              temp += mul;
            }
          }
          sol[r * 64 + c] = temp;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling:** Applied to the outer loops (`r` and `c`) to break down the computation into smaller chunks that fit better into the FPGA's on-chip memory, improving data locality and potentially reducing the memory access latency. The tile sizes (`TILE_R` and `TILE_C`) are parameters that should be tuned based on the specific FPGA architecture and the available on-chip memory.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation:** This transformation changes the order of loops to optimize memory access patterns. By moving the computation closer to the innermost loop, we ensure that data loaded into the on-chip memory is used efficiently before being evicted. This can significantly reduce the number of memory accesses and improve the overall performance.
// 
// 3. **Pragma Directives:** The `#pragma ACCEL` directives are hints to the HLS tool for further optimizations like pipelining and parallelizing the loops. These directives are kept as-is from the original code but can be adjusted based on the transformations applied and the specific requirements of the target FPGA architecture.
// 
// ### Note:
// The choice of tile sizes and the specific transformations applied should be guided by the target FPGA's architecture, the available resources, and the specific requirements of the application. It's often beneficial to experiment with different configurations and use the FPGA vendor's HLS tools to analyze the performance and resource utilization of different optimization strategies.
