// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The original code already includes pragmas for pipeline and tiling, suggesting an intention to optimize for parallel execution and efficient data access. However, to further enhance its performance, we can consider additional transformations like loop permutation, loop tiling (already hinted at but we can refine it), loop distribution, and loop fusion where applicable.
// 
// ### Original Loop Structure:
// 1. Loop over `r`
// 2. Loop over `q`
// 3. Loop over `p`
// 4. Innermost loop over `s`
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This involves swapping the loops to improve data locality. However, due to the dependencies in accessing `A[r][q][s]` and `C4[s][p]`, the innermost two loops (`p` and `s`) cannot be permuted without affecting the correctness. The outer loops (`r` and `q`) are already in a good order considering the memory access patterns.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: The code already suggests tiling, but no specific tile sizes are provided. Tiling can help with data locality and can make better use of the cache. However, without specific hardware details, setting the tile size to 'auto' might rely on the compiler's heuristics. For this transformation, we'll assume hypothetical tile sizes for demonstration purposes.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This technique involves splitting a loop into multiple loops with the same range but performing different operations. It can be beneficial when different iterations of the loop have different resource requirements or to improve pipelining. However, in this case, loop distribution is already implicitly applied in the computation of `sum[p]` and the update of `A[r][q][p]`.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: This technique combines loops that have the same loop bounds and are independent of each other. However, in this scenario, there's no straightforward opportunity for loop fusion without affecting the program's semantics.
// 
// Given the constraints and the original optimizations hinted at in the code, we'll focus on a hypothetical loop tiling transformation for demonstration. Note that without specific hardware details, the choice of tile sizes is arbitrary and meant for illustrative purposes.
// 
// ### Transformed Code with Hypothetical Loop Tiling:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(int nr, int nq, int np, double A[25][20][30], double C4[30][30], double sum[30]) {
  int r, q, p, s;
  int rr, qq, pp; // For tiling
  // Assuming tile sizes for demonstration
  int R_TILE = 5, Q_TILE = 5, P_TILE = 10;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (r = 0; r < 25; r += R_TILE) {
    for (q = 0; q < 20; q += Q_TILE) {
      for (p = 0; p < 30; p += P_TILE) {
        // Tiled loops
        for (rr = r; rr < r + R_TILE && rr < 25; rr++) {
          for (qq = q; qq < q + Q_TILE && qq < 20; qq++) {
            for (pp = p; pp < p + P_TILE && pp < 30; pp++) {
              sum[pp] = 0.0;
              for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
                sum[pp] += A[rr][qq][s] * C4[s][pp];
              }
            }
            for (pp = p; pp < p + P_TILE && pp < 30; pp++) {
              A[rr][qq][pp] = sum[pp];
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind the Transformation:
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the `r`, `q`, and `p` loops to potentially improve cache utilization by working on smaller, contiguous blocks of data at a time. The choice of tile sizes (`R_TILE`, `Q_TILE`, `P_TILE`) is arbitrary and should be tuned based on the target architecture's cache sizes and the specifics of the memory hierarchy.
// - The original pipeline and tile pragmas are kept generic (`auto`), assuming the HLS tool can make informed decisions. In practice, specific pipeline depths and tile sizes might need to be manually specified for optimal performance.
// 
// Remember, the effectiveness of these transformations heavily depends on the target hardware and the specifics of the compiler or HLS tool used. Testing and profiling are essential to find the optimal configuration.
