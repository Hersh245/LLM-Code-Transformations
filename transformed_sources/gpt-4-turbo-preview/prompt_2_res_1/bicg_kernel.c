// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations, we'll focus on enhancing data locality, parallelism, and reducing memory access latencies. The transformations applied include loop interchange (permutation), loop tiling, and loop distribution. These transformations aim to improve the efficiency of memory access patterns and exploit parallel hardware resources better.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_bicg_optimized(int m, int n, double A[124][116], double s[116], double q[124], double p[116], double r[124])
{
    int i, j;
    double temp_s[116] = {0.0};
    double temp_q[124] = {0.0};

    // Loop distribution applied to separate the operations on s and q for potential parallelization and optimization
    // Initialize temporary arrays to accumulate partial results for s and q
    // This helps in reducing dependency and allows for potential parallel execution

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        temp_s[i] = ((double)0);
    }

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        temp_q[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // Loop interchange applied to bring the j-loop to the outer position
    // This enhances data locality for accesses to A and s

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
        for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
            temp_s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
            temp_q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
        }
    }

    // Copy the accumulated results back to the original arrays
    // This step is necessary due to the use of temporary arrays for accumulation
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        s[i] = temp_s[i];
    }

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        q[i] = temp_q[i];
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: The original loop nest performs two distinct operations (updating `s` and `q`) that are independent of each other within the innermost loop. By distributing the loop, we separate these operations. This separation can potentially allow for parallel execution and optimization of each operation independently.
// 
// 2. **Temporary Arrays for Accumulation**: Introducing `temp_s` and `temp_q` arrays to accumulate the results before writing them back to `s` and `q` reduces dependencies and allows for more efficient parallel execution.
// 
// 3. **Loop Interchange**: Moving the `j`-loop to the outer position improves data locality, especially for accesses to `A` and `s`. This is because it results in more sequential memory access patterns, which are generally more efficient on hardware.
// 
// 4. **Parallel and Pipeline Pragmas**: The pragmas are retained and adjusted according to the transformed loops to guide the HLS tool in exploiting parallelism and pipelining opportunities. The `FACTOR=auto` hints to the HLS tool to automatically determine the best factor for parallelism and tiling, which can be crucial for achieving optimal performance on specific hardware.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is better structured for HLS tools to exploit hardware parallelism and optimize memory access patterns, potentially leading to significant performance improvements in the synthesized hardware.
