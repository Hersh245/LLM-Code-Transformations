// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax, int nx, int ny, double ex[60][80], double ey[60][80], double hz[60][80], double _fict_[40]) {
    int t, i, j;

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
    for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
        // Loop fusion for ey[0][j] updates and the subsequent ey[i][j] updates
        // This reduces the loop overhead and improves data locality
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
        ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];
        for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
            for (i = 1; i < 60; i++) {
                ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);
            }
        }

        // Loop tiling for ex[i][j] updates to improve cache utilization and enable finer-grained parallelism
        int TILE_SIZE = 16; // Example tile size, can be tuned for specific hardware
        for (i = 0; i < 60; i += TILE_SIZE) {
            for (j = 1; j < 80; j += TILE_SIZE) {
                #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_2}
                for (int ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE && ii < 60; ii++) {
                    for (int jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE && jj < 80; jj++) {
                        ex[ii][jj] = ex[ii][jj] - 0.5 * (hz[ii][jj] - hz[ii][jj - 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Loop interchange in the hz[i][j] update loop to improve spatial locality
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_3}
        for (j = 0; j < 79; j++) {
            for (i = 0; i < 59; i++) {
                hz[i][j] = hz[i][j] - 0.7 * (ex[i][j + 1] - ex[i][j] + ey[i + 1][j] - ey[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: The initial loops updating `ey[0][j]` and `ey[i][j]` are fused into a single loop iteration over `j` and then `i`. This reduces the number of loop iterations and improves data locality since `ey` is accessed sequentially.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: For the update of `ex[i][j]`, loop tiling (also known as loop blocking) is applied. This transformation helps to keep the accessed data in cache longer, reducing memory access latency and improving cache utilization. The choice of `TILE_SIZE` depends on the specific cache architecture and should be tuned accordingly.
// 
// 3. **Loop Interchange**: In the final loop updating `hz[i][j]`, loop interchange is applied to switch the order of the `i` and `j` loops. This improves spatial locality since consecutive iterations of the inner loop access adjacent memory locations, which is beneficial for memory access patterns on many architectures.
// 
// 4. **Pragma Directives**: The original pragma directives for pipeline, tile, and parallel are retained and applied to the transformed loops. These directives hint to the HLS tool to apply specific optimizations like pipelining loop iterations, applying loop tiling optimizations, and exploiting parallelism within loops. The `auto` factor allows the HLS tool to automatically determine the best factor for each directive based on the target architecture and constraints.
// 
// These transformations aim to improve the performance of the code on hardware accelerators by enhancing data locality, reducing loop overhead, and enabling more efficient parallel execution.
