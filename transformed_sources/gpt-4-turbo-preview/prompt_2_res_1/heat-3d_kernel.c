// To optimize the provided code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

    int t, i, j, k;

    // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
    // This can also help in achieving better parallelism.
    // The tile size is chosen based on typical FPGA on-chip memory sizes and the specific problem size.
    // Here, we assume a tile size of 10 for demonstration, but this can be adjusted based on the target FPGA.
    int TILE_SIZE = 10;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is applied to both the `B` array computation and the `A` array update loops. Loop tiling helps in breaking down the loops into smaller chunks that can fit into the FPGA's on-chip memory, improving data locality and reducing memory access latency. It also opens up opportunities for parallel execution of independent tiles.
// 
// 2. **Pipeline Pragmas**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto` directive is kept within the innermost loop of each tile processing section. This directive instructs the HLS tool to attempt to pipeline the loop, allowing for concurrent execution of different iterations of the loop, thereby increasing the throughput of the computation.
// 
// 3. **Parallelism and Tile Factor Pragmas**: The original pragmas for parallelism and tile factor (`#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto` and `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto`) are kept at the top to apply to the entire function, indicating that automatic decisions should be made by the HLS tool for parallel execution and tiling at higher levels of the loop nest. However, the effectiveness and applicability of these pragmas depend on the specific HLS tool and target FPGA architecture.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is optimized for HLS targeting FPGAs, aiming to exploit spatial and temporal locality, parallelism, and efficient use of on-chip memory resources.
