// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the code, we can apply several optimizations to improve the performance of the `kernel_heat_3d` function. The primary goals of these optimizations are to reduce the number of cycles per call (CPC) and to improve data locality, which can be achieved through loop transformations such as loop tiling and loop permutation. 
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// 
// The original code performs a 3D heat distribution calculation over a small 20x20x20 grid. The primary computation loops are nested within a time-stepping loop. The performance report indicates that the two main computation loops (updating `B` from `A` and then `A` from `B`) are the most time-consuming parts of the program, each taking approximately 49.6% of the total cycles.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation can improve cache utilization by working on smaller sub-blocks of the data array at a time. Given the size of the data arrays and the cache sizes mentioned in the memory burst reports, a tile size that fits well into the cache should be chosen.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the order of the loops might improve spatial locality and thus cache performance. Since the innermost loop accesses continuous memory locations, it's beneficial to keep it as the innermost loop if possible.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion/Distribution**: Depending on the access patterns, it might be beneficial to fuse loops that perform operations on the same dataset to improve temporal locality. However, in this case, since the operations need to be done separately on `A` and `B`, loop fusion might not be applicable. Loop distribution is already implicitly applied.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
// 
// Below is the transformed code with loop tiling and loop permutation applied. Note that the specific tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I`, `TILE_SIZE_J`, `TILE_SIZE_K`) need to be defined based on cache size and experimentation for optimal performance.

// ### Rationale
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to improve cache locality by processing the data in smaller blocks that fit into the cache more efficiently.
// - **Loop Permutation**: Not explicitly applied in the transformed code above, as the original loop order was already optimal for memory access patterns (sequential access in the innermost loop).
// - **Pragma Directives**: All original pragma directives have been kept to ensure that the compiler's high-level synthesis optimizations are still applied.
// 
// ### Conclusion
// 
// This transformed code aims to improve the performance of the `kernel_heat_3d` function by applying loop tiling to enhance data locality. Further optimizations might include adjusting tile sizes based on actual cache sizes and experimenting with loop permutation if profiling suggests further improvements can be made.
