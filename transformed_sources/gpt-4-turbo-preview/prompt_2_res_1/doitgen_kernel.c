// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the original code, we can apply several optimizations to improve its performance for High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The key areas to focus on are loop transformations that can enhance data locality, reduce memory access times, and increase the level of parallelism. The transformations considered here are:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This can improve cache utilization by working on smaller chunks of the data at a time.
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: Combining loops that iterate over the same range can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality.
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the order of nested loops can improve memory access patterns, making them more sequential.
// 
// Given the structure of the loops and the operations performed within them, loop fusion seems immediately applicable to the two innermost loops iterating over `p`. Loop tiling could be beneficial for the `r` and `q` loops, but given the fixed sizes and the nature of the operations (which involve reductions across one dimension), the biggest gains might come from loop fusion and possibly loop permutation.
// 
// Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(int nr, int nq, int np, double A[25][20][30], double C4[30][30], double sum[30]) {
  int r, q, p, s;

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  for (r = 0; r < 25; r++) {
    
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
    for (q = 0; q < 20; q++) {
      
      // Loop Fusion: Combining the computation and update of A[r][q][p] into a single loop over 'p'
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
      #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
      for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
        sum[p] = 0.0;
        for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
          sum[p] += A[r][q][s] * C4[s][p];
        }
        A[r][q][p] = sum[p]; // Move the update of A inside the loop over 'p'
      }
    }
  }
}
// **Rationale for Transformations:**
// 
// - **Loop Fusion**: The original code had two separate loops iterating over `p` with the same bounds. The first loop was calculating `sum[p]`, and the second loop was updating `A[r][q][p]` with the value of `sum[p]`. By fusing these loops, we reduce the number of iterations from 2x30 to 1x30 for each combination of `r` and `q`, which can decrease the overhead of loop control and improve data locality since `sum[p]` is used immediately after it's computed. This transformation should help reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC) by reducing the overhead and potentially increasing data locality.
// 
// - **Loop Permutation and Tiling**: Given the access patterns and the operations performed, loop permutation was considered but not applied, as the original loop order seems to be optimal for the given computation (reduction across `s` and then updating `A[r][q][p]`). Loop tiling was also considered, but without specific cache size details and more complex access patterns, it's hard to apply effectively without empirical testing. The `#pragma ACCEL TILE` directives suggest that the compiler or HLS tool might already be applying some form of automatic tiling or partitioning based on the `auto` factor, which could be further tuned if specific performance bottlenecks were identified.
// 
// These transformations aim to maintain or improve the performance characteristics of the original code while potentially reducing the total accumulated cycles and improving efficiency for High-Level Synthesis.
