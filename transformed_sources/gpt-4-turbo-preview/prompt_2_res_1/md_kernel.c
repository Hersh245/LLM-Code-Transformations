// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the code, we can observe that the majority of the execution time is spent within the nested loops (`loop_i` and `loop_j`). The inner loop (`loop_j`) is already pipelined but has a pipeline initiation interval (II) of 5, which indicates that there's a potential for optimization. The goal of the optimizations would be to reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC) for improved performance.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// 
// - The outer loop (`loop_i`) iterates over all particles to calculate forces based on their positions and the positions of their neighbors.
// - The inner loop (`loop_j`) iterates over the neighbors of each particle.
// - The pragma directives suggest an intent to parallelize and optimize the loops for hardware acceleration.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: There's no immediate opportunity for loop fusion as the primary computation is encapsulated within two tightly coupled loops.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique isn't directly applicable here due to the nature of the algorithm, which involves pairwise interactions rather than operations on large blocks of data that could benefit from tiling for cache efficiency.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: Not applicable as there's no independent set of operations within the loops that could be separated to improve data locality or parallelism.
// 
// 4. **Loop Unrolling**: Applying loop unrolling to the inner loop (`loop_j`) could potentially reduce the initiation interval (II) by allowing for more parallel computation of the force calculations. However, care must be taken not to increase resource usage excessively.
// 
// 5. **Loop Permutation**: Not applicable as there are only two nested loops, and their order is determined by the algorithm's logic.
// 
// ### Optimized Code with Loop Unrolling
// 
// Given the analysis, the most promising optimization for this code is to apply loop unrolling to the inner loop. This optimization aims to increase the amount of work done per iteration of the loop, potentially reducing the pipeline initiation interval (II) and making better use of available hardware resources.

// ### Rationale
// 
// - **Loop Unrolling**: By unrolling the inner loop, we aim to decrease the pipeline initiation interval (II) by performing more operations in parallel within each iteration. This should ideally lead to a reduction in the total accumulated cycles (AC) and improve the overall performance of the kernel.
// - **Maintaining Original Pragmas**: The original pragma directives for pipeline, tile, and parallel factor optimizations are kept intact to ensure that the compiler's high-level synthesis (HLS) can still apply automatic optimizations based on the hardware target.
// 
// ### Note
// 
// The effectiveness of this optimization depends on the specific hardware target and the HLS tool's ability to efficiently map the unrolled computations. It's essential to profile the optimized code to ensure that the expected performance improvements are realized.
