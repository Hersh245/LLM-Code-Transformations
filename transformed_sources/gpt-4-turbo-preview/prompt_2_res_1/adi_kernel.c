// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the provided C code, we can identify several opportunities for optimization. The primary targets for optimization are the nested loops within the `kernel_adi` function, specifically the loops labeled `loop i` and `loop j` in both the column and row sweep sections. These loops account for a significant portion of the execution time, as indicated by the accumulated cycles (AC) in the performance estimate.
// 
// ### Original Code Analysis
// 
// - The `loop i` and `loop j` in both column and row sweeps are the most time-consuming parts of the code.
// - The `loop j` in both sweeps is already parallelized and pipelined, which is good for performance. However, there might be room for further optimization, especially in how data is accessed and loop iterations are ordered.
// - Memory access patterns in the `loop j` iterations could potentially be optimized to improve data locality and reduce cache misses.
// 
// ### Proposed Optimizations
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This technique can be applied to improve cache utilization by processing data in smaller blocks that fit into the cache, reducing memory access times. Given the size of the arrays and the cache sizes mentioned in the memory burst details, a careful selection of tile sizes is required.
// 
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: Where applicable, combining loops that have the same loop bounds and are independent can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can sometimes improve performance by optimizing memory access patterns, especially for multidimensional arrays.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
// 
// Considering the above strategies, let's focus on loop tiling as a primary optimization technique. Due to the complexity of the code and the specific optimizations already applied (e.g., parallelization and pipelining), a detailed, correct transformation requires careful consideration of dependencies and potential data hazards. The following is a conceptual transformation that applies loop tiling to the `loop i` and `loop j` of the column sweep as an example. Similar transformations can be applied to the row sweep.
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_adi_optimized(int tsteps, int n, double u[60][60], double v[60][60], double p[60][60], double q[60][60]) {
    // Variable declarations remain unchanged

    // Constants initialization remains unchanged

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (t = 1; t <= 40; t++) {
        // Column Sweep
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
        for (int ii = 1; ii < 59; ii += TILE_SIZE) { // Assuming TILE_SIZE is defined and is a divisor of 58
            int i_max = ii + TILE_SIZE < 59 ? ii + TILE_SIZE : 59;
            for (i = ii; i < i_max; i++) {
                v[0][i] = 1.0;
                p[i][0] = 0.0;
                q[i][0] = v[0][i];
                for (j = 1; j < 59; j++) {
                    // Inner loop calculations remain unchanged
                }
                v[60 - 1][i] = 1.0;
                for (j = 0; j <= 57; j++) {
                    // Reverse loop calculations remain unchanged
                }
            }
        }
        // Row Sweep with similar loop tiling transformation
    }
}
// **Note:** The above transformation is conceptual and focuses on loop tiling. The exact `TILE_SIZE` needs to be determined based on cache sizes and the specific hardware characteristics. Additionally, the transformed code assumes that dependencies within the tiled loops are properly managed, which may require further analysis and adjustments.
// 
// **Rationale:**
// - **Loop Tiling**: This is applied to improve data locality and cache utilization. By processing data in blocks, we reduce the number of cache misses and potentially lower the memory access times.
// - The original pragmas for pipeline, tile, and parallel are retained to ensure that the compiler's high-level synthesis can still apply hardware-specific optimizations.
// 
// **Caveat:** The actual implementation of these optimizations requires careful testing and validation to ensure correctness and to measure performance improvements. The effectiveness of these optimizations can vary based on the specific hardware and compiler capabilities.
