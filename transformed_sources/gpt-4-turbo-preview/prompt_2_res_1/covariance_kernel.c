// Based on the performance estimates provided in the `merlin.rpt` file, the most time-consuming part of the `kernel_covariance` function is the nested loop structure starting at `loop i (cnn-krnl.cpp:44)`. This loop and its nested loops account for approximately 98.5% of the accumulated cycles. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we should focus on this part of the code, applying transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, while considering the impact on trip count (TC), accumulated cycles (AC), and cycles per call (CPC).
// 
// Here's a transformed version of the code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_covariance(int m,int n,double float_n,double data[100][80],double cov[80][80],double mean[80])
{
  int i;
  int j;
  int k;

  // Original pragmas preserved as requested
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    mean[j] = 0.0;
    
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=mean FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      mean[j] += data[i][j];
    }
    mean[j] /= float_n;
  }

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=data FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      data[i][j] -= mean[j];
    }
  }

  // Loop permutation applied to improve data locality and cache usage
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    for (i = j; i < 80; i++) {
      cov[i][j] = 0.0;

      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L5}
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=cov FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
      for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
        cov[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
      }
      cov[i][j] /= float_n - 1.0;
      if (i != j) {
        cov[j][i] = cov[i][j];
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale for Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: The original code computes `cov[i][j]` and then immediately assigns `cov[j][i] = cov[i][j]`. By permuting the loops for `i` and `j` in the covariance calculation, we ensure that when `cov[i][j]` is computed, `cov[j][i]` is also computed in the same or adjacent iterations, improving spatial locality and potentially cache hit rates. This change also avoids redundant computations.
// 
// 2. **Maintained Pragmas**: All original pragmas are preserved to ensure that compiler directives for parallelization, pipelining, and tiling are still considered by the HLS tool. These pragmas are crucial for informing the HLS tool about potential parallelism and optimization opportunities.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion/Distribution**: No loop fusion or distribution was applied in this transformation as the primary focus was on loop permutation. However, these techniques could be considered in further optimizations, especially if there are independent operations within loops that could benefit from being merged (fusion) or if separating complex loops into simpler, separate loops (distribution) could improve readability, parallelism, or data locality.
// 
// This transformed code aims to optimize the performance by focusing on the most time-consuming parts of the function, as identified in the provided performance estimates, while maintaining the original parallelization and optimization directives provided by the pragmas.
