// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The primary goal is to improve data locality, parallelism, and reduce memory access latency. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m,int n,double A[116][124],double x[124],double y[124],double tmp[116])
{
  int i;
  int j;
  
  // Initialize y to 0
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) 
    y[i] = ((double )0);
  
  // Loop tiling is applied here to improve cache locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // Tile sizes are chosen based on typical cache line sizes and available on-chip memory.
  // Assuming a tile size of 32 for demonstration, but this should be tuned based on the target architecture.
  int TILE_SIZE = 32;
  
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i += TILE_SIZE) {
    int i_max = i + TILE_SIZE > 116 ? 116 : i + TILE_SIZE;
    
    // Initialize tmp for the current tile
    for (int ii = i; ii < i_max; ii++) {
      tmp[ii] = 0.0;
    }
    
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j += TILE_SIZE) {
      int j_max = j + TILE_SIZE > 124 ? 124 : j + TILE_SIZE;
      
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
      
      // Distribute the loop to separate the accumulation in tmp and the update of y
      // This allows for better pipelining and parallel execution of independent operations.
      
      // First part: Accumulate in tmp
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
      for (int ii = i; ii < i_max; ii++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
        for (int jj = j; jj < j_max; jj++) {
          tmp[ii] += A[ii][jj] * x[jj];
        }
      }
      
      // Second part: Update y based on tmp
      // This loop is intentionally kept outside of the jj loop to ensure all updates to tmp are completed.
      // This is a form of loop distribution.
    }
    
    for (int ii = i; ii < i_max; ii++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
      for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
        y[j] += A[ii][j] * tmp[ii];
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to both `i` and `j` loops to improve data locality and cache usage. By processing the data in smaller blocks (tiles), we ensure that the working set of data fits into the faster levels of cache, reducing memory access latency and improving overall performance. The tile size (`TILE_SIZE`) should be chosen based on the target architecture's cache size and memory bandwidth.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The original loop over `j` for calculating `tmp` and updating `y` is split into two separate loops. This transformation allows for better pipelining and parallel execution because the accumulation in `tmp` and the update of `y` are independent operations. By distributing the loops, we can potentially increase the utilization of computational resources.
// 
// 3. **Parallel Pragmas**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` and `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directives are retained and applied to the innermost loops where possible to hint at the compiler for parallel execution and pipelining. The `reduction` clause is crucial for ensuring correct accumulation in `tmp` and `y` across iterations.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: Not directly applied here, but by restructuring the loops and applying loop tiling and distribution, we've essentially reorganized the computation in a way that could be seen as an inverse of loop fusion, aiming for better parallelism and memory access patterns.
// 
// These transformations are aimed at improving the performance of the code on hardware accelerators by enhancing data locality, reducing memory access times, and enabling more efficient parallel execution. However, the exact benefits and optimal parameters (like `TILE_SIZE`) depend on the specifics of the target hardware architecture, and further tuning may be required.
