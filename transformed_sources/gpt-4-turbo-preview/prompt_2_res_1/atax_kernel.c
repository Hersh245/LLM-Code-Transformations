// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the original code, we can consider several optimizations. The key insights from the performance report are:
// 
// 1. The loop at `cnn-krnl.cpp:22` has a relatively high accumulated cycle count and a pipeline initiation interval (II) of 5, indicating that this loop is a significant bottleneck.
// 2. The loop at `cnn-krnl.cpp:27` has a lower accumulated cycle count but can still be optimized for better performance.
// 
// Based on these insights, here are some potential optimizations:
// 
// - **Loop Fusion**: Combining loops that work on the same data set can reduce the overhead of loop control and potentially increase data locality. However, in this case, loop fusion does not seem applicable due to the dependency between the loops (the second loop depends on the completion of the first loop for each iteration of `i`).
// 
// - **Loop Distribution**: Splitting a loop that performs two or more independent operations into multiple loops can improve data locality and parallelism. This strategy is not directly applicable here since the operations inside the loop are dependent.
// 
// - **Loop Tiling (Blocking)**: This technique can be used to improve cache utilization by processing data in smaller blocks that fit into the cache. This is applicable for the nested loops but requires careful consideration of the data dependencies.
// 
// - **Loop Permutation (Interchange)**: Swapping the order of nested loops can improve data locality and cache usage. This might be beneficial for the nested loops accessing the `A` array.
// 
// Given the structure of the original code and the performance report, the most promising optimization seems to be loop interchange, considering the memory access patterns to `A`, `x`, and `y`. However, due to the dependencies between the operations inside the loop, a straightforward loop interchange might not be directly applicable without further analysis of data dependencies.
// 
// Here is an attempt to optimize the code with these considerations in mind. Note that without a deeper analysis of data dependencies and without testing, these optimizations are speculative:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax_optimized(int m, int n, double A[116][124], double x[124], double y[124], double tmp[116]) {
    int i, j;

    // Initialize y to 0
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++)
        y[i] = ((double)0);

    // The original code is already well-structured for the given problem.
    // Direct loop interchange or tiling might not be applicable without violating data dependencies.
    // However, ensuring all pragmas are included and considering potential compiler optimizations is crucial.

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        tmp[i] = 0.0;

        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
        for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
            tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }

        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
        for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
            y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
        }
    }
}
// In this optimized version, the focus is on maintaining the original structure while ensuring that all directives for parallelism and optimization are properly annotated. Given the dependencies and the structure of the loops, more advanced optimizations such as loop tiling or interchange might require a deeper analysis of the algorithm to ensure correctness.
