// Given the performance estimates and the structure of the original code, it's clear that the most time-consuming part is the nested loops, particularly the loop over `k` and the innermost loop over `j` within it. To optimize this code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations, including loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, and possibly loop fusion, while keeping the original pragmas in place to guide the HLS tool in optimizing the hardware implementation.
// 
// ### Optimized Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk_optimized(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60]) {
    int i, j, k;

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            C[i][j] *= beta;
        }
    }

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
            for (k = 0; k < 60; k++) {
                C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: The original code performs two distinct operations within the outer `i` loop: scaling `C[i][j]` by `beta` and accumulating the product of `alpha`, `A[i][k]`, and `A[j][k]` into `C[i][j]`. By distributing these loops, we separate these concerns, making it clearer to the HLS tool how to optimize memory accesses and parallelism. This transformation could potentially allow for better pipelining and parallel execution of independent operations.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: The original inner loops over `j` and `k` are nested in a way that might not be optimal for memory access patterns, especially considering the dependencies in the matrix multiplication and accumulation. However, given the nature of the computation (symmetric rank-k update), the options for permuting loops are limited without changing the algorithm's semantics. The primary transformation here is distributing the loops over `j` and `k` to separate the scaling and accumulation operations.
// 
// 3. **Maintaining Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been kept in place to ensure that the HLS tool's guidance for parallelism, pipelining, and tiling is preserved. These pragmas are crucial for informing the HLS tool about the intended parallelism and optimization strategies, especially in the context of FPGA synthesis where resource utilization and timing constraints are critical.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: There's no direct application of loop fusion in this transformation since the primary goal was to distribute the loops to separate the scaling and accumulation operations. However, by restructuring the loops and keeping the operations within their respective distributed loops, we aim for a more efficient execution model that could be implicitly better managed by the HLS tool.
// 
// ### Expected Impact
// 
// - **Improved Memory Access**: By distributing the loops and separating the scaling and accumulation operations, we might improve the locality of memory accesses, especially for the `C` matrix.
// - **Enhanced Parallelism**: Keeping the pragmas and restructuring the loops could allow the HLS tool to better exploit parallelism, potentially leading to a reduction in accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC).
// - **Pipeline Efficiency**: With clearer separation of concerns and potentially improved memory access patterns, the HLS tool might be able to more effectively pipeline the operations, especially the accumulation loop, which is the most computationally intensive part of the algorithm.
// 
// These transformations aim to guide the HLS tool in generating a more efficient hardware implementation, potentially reducing the overall execution time and improving resource utilization on the target FPGA.
