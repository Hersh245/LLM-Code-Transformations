// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void stencil(int orig[8192], int sol[8192], int filter[9]) {
    int r, c, k1, k2, temp, mul;

    // Applying loop tiling to improve data locality and enable more effective pipelining and parallelism
    int TILE_SIZE_R = 16; // Example tile size for 'r' dimension, adjust based on available resources
    int TILE_SIZE_C = 16; // Example tile size for 'c' dimension, adjust based on available resources

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

    // Outer tiled loops
    for(int tr = 0; tr < 128 - 2; tr += TILE_SIZE_R) {
        for(int tc = 0; tc < 64 - 2; tc += TILE_SIZE_C) {

            // Inner loops within each tile
            #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
            for(r = tr; r < tr + TILE_SIZE_R && r < 128 - 2; ++r) {
                for(c = tc; c < tc + TILE_SIZE_C && c < 64 - 2; ++c) {
                    temp = 0;

                    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
                    for(k1 = 0; k1 < 3; ++k1) {
                        for(k2 = 0; k2 < 3; ++k2) {
                            mul = filter[k1 * 3 + k2] * orig[(r + k1) * 64 + c + k2];
                            temp += mul;
                        }
                    }
                    sol[r * 64 + c] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** This transformation is applied to the `r` and `c` loops. Loop tiling helps in improving data locality by processing the data in smaller blocks that fit into the FPGA's local memory (such as block RAMs or registers), which can significantly reduce the latency associated with accessing data from global memory. It also enables more efficient use of parallel resources within the FPGA.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation:** Although not explicitly applied in the transformed code, loop permutation could be considered based on the memory access patterns and the architecture of the target FPGA. For instance, swapping the `k1` and `k2` loops, or the order of the tiled loops and the computation loops, might offer better performance depending on how data is stored and accessed in memory.
// 
// 3. **Pipelining:** The use of `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` remains crucial in the transformed code. Pipelining allows for the concurrent execution of different iterations of a loop, which can significantly improve the throughput of the computation. The transformed code maintains the pipelining directives to ensure that the FPGA compiler attempts to pipeline the loops as much as possible, given the resource constraints.
// 
// 4. **Parallelism:** The pragmas related to parallelism (`#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto`) are kept to hint at the HLS tool to automatically infer the level of parallelism that can be achieved. This is particularly important when dealing with tiled loops, as it allows the compiler to optimize the execution of operations within each tile.
// 
// ### Note:
// - The choice of `TILE_SIZE_R` and `TILE_SIZE_C` should be based on the specific FPGA architecture and the available resources. These values may need to be tuned to achieve the best performance.
// - It's essential to profile the code and experiment with different transformations and pragma settings, as the optimal configuration can vary significantly depending on the specifics of the hardware and the nature of the computation.
