// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which can lead to better performance on hardware accelerators. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void stencil(int orig[8192], int sol[8192], int filter[9]) {
    int r, c, k1, k2, temp, mul;

    // Loop tiling for the outer two loops to improve data locality and enable more effective pipelining
    int TILE_SIZE_R = 16; // Example tile size for 'r' loop, adjust based on available resources
    int TILE_SIZE_C = 16; // Example tile size for 'c' loop, adjust based on available resources

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

    // Tiled loops for 'r' and 'c'
    for (int rt = 0; rt < 128 - 2; rt += TILE_SIZE_R) {
        for (int ct = 0; ct < 64 - 2; ct += TILE_SIZE_C) {

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}

            // Original loops adjusted for tiling
            for (r = rt; r < rt + TILE_SIZE_R && r < 128 - 2; r++) {
                for (c = ct; c < ct + TILE_SIZE_C && c < 64 - 2; c++) {
                    temp = 0;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
                    // Inner loops remain unchanged
                    for (k1 = 0; k1 < 3; k1++) {
                        for (k2 = 0; k2 < 3; k2++) {
                            mul = filter[k1 * 3 + k2] * orig[(r + k1) * 64 + c + k2];
                            temp += mul;
                        }
                    }
                    sol[r * 64 + c] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: The outer two loops iterating over `r` and `c` are tiled. Loop tiling, also known as loop blocking, breaks down the loops into smaller chunks or "tiles". This transformation improves data locality by working on smaller subsets of the data at a time, which can be more efficiently cached. It also opens up opportunities for further optimizations like parallel execution of independent tiles.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Although not explicitly applied in the transformed code, loop permutation could be considered if it were beneficial to interchange the loop order for better memory access patterns. In this specific case, the original loop order is already optimal for accessing the `orig` array in a linear fashion.
// 
// 3. **Maintaining Pragmas**: The original pragmas for pipelining, tiling, and parallelization are maintained and applied to the outermost loops and the newly created tiled loops. These pragmas give hints to the HLS tool to explore automatic pipelining, automatic tiling factors, and parallel execution where possible. The exact factors for tiling and parallelization are left as `auto` for the HLS tool to decide, but in practice, these might need to be tuned manually for optimal performance.
// 
// 4. **No Loop Fusion/Distribution Applied**: Loop fusion combines multiple loops that have the same loop bounds into a single loop, which can reduce loop overhead and improve cache utilization. Loop distribution splits a loop into multiple loops over the same range but with different bodies, which can help in pipelining and parallel execution. In this code, neither transformation is directly applied because the focus is on tiling for data locality and maintaining the original computation structure for clarity. However, these transformations could be considered in a broader optimization context depending on the specific hardware targets and performance goals.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is better structured for HLS tools to exploit parallelism and improve data locality, which can lead to more efficient hardware implementations.
