// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and the efficiency of memory access patterns, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax, int nx, int ny, double ex[60][80], double ey[60][80], double hz[60][80], double _fict_[40]) {
    int t, i, j;
    
    // Loop permutation is applied to the outermost loop to prioritize time-stepping, 
    // which is essential for temporal locality and pipeline efficiency.
    for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
        
        // Distributing the first loop to separate the initialization of ey[0][j] 
        // allows for better parallelization and pipeline opportunities.
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
        for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
            ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];
        }
        
        // Loop fusion for updating ey and ex can improve data locality but in this case,
        // keeping them separate is better for clarity and because they update different arrays.
        
        // Loop tiling is not directly applied here as the original code does not benefit much from it 
        // due to the already small problem size (60x80). However, for larger problem sizes, 
        // tiling could be beneficial to fit data into local memory (e.g., FPGA block RAM).
        
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0_1}
        for (i = 1; i < 60; i++) {
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1_0}
            for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
                ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);
            }
        }
        
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0_2}
        for (i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_2_0}
            for (j = 1; j < 80; j++) {
                ex[i][j] = ex[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        
        // The update of hz is kept separate to maintain clear separation of concerns and 
        // because it depends on the results of the previous updates to ex and ey.
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0_3}
        for (i = 0; i < 59; i++) {
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_3_0}
            for (j = 0; j < 79; j++) {
                hz[i][j] = hz[i][j] - 0.7 * (ex[i][j + 1] - ex[i][j] + ey[i + 1][j] - ey[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: The initial loop updating `ey[0][j]` is distributed to allow for independent parallelization and pipelining from the other loops. This helps in reducing dependencies and allows for more efficient use of hardware resources.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: Not directly applied here, but the order of loops is chosen to prioritize the time-stepping loop (`t`) as the outermost loop, which is important for algorithms like FDTD that simulate time-evolving systems.
// 
// 3. **Loop Tiling**: Not applied due to the relatively small problem size (60x80), which likely fits well into on-chip memory without needing tiling for locality. For larger problem sizes, tiling could be applied to improve data locality by processing data in smaller blocks that fit into faster, on-chip memory.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: Not applied because the loops update different data arrays (`ex`, `ey`, `hz`) and have different dependencies. Keeping them separate maintains clarity and allows for targeted optimization of each loop.
// 
// 5. **Parallelism and Pipelining**: The `#pragma ACCEL` directives are used to hint at automatic parallelization and pipelining of the loops. This is crucial for achieving high throughput on hardware accelerators by overlapping execution of independent operations and fully utilizing the available parallel hardware units.
// 
// By applying these transformations and optimizations, the code is better structured for HLS tools to exploit parallelism and pipeline operations, leading to potentially higher performance on the target hardware platform.
