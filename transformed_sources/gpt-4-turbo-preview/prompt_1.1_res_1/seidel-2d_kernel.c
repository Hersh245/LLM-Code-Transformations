// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we need to consider the specific goals we're aiming for, such as parallelism, pipelining, and data locality. The original code already includes pragmas for pipelining, tiling, and parallelism, but we can further optimize it by applying loop transformations that enhance these aspects.
// 
// ### Loop Tiling
// 
// Loop tiling can improve data locality and make better use of the cache by processing data in small blocks. This is particularly effective for nested loops that access arrays.
// 
// ### Loop Permutation
// 
// Loop permutation can be used to change the order of nested loops to improve data locality or to enable other optimizations like vectorization.
// 
// ### Loop Fusion
// 
// Loop fusion combines two adjacent loops that have the same loop bounds into a single loop, which can reduce loop overhead and improve data locality.
// 
// ### Loop Distribution
// 
// Loop distribution splits a loop into multiple loops over the same range but each performing a part of the original loop's body. It can be used to separate independent computations, which can then be optimized separately.
// 
// Given the nature of the code, which involves updating a 2D array based on its neighbors, loop tiling seems to be the most beneficial transformation. Loop permutation and loop fusion don't seem directly applicable here due to the dependencies between iterations. Loop distribution isn't directly applicable either, as the core computation is a single expression.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with loop tiling applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_seidel_2d(int tsteps, int n, double A[120][120]) {
    int t, i, j, ii, jj;
    const int TILE_SIZE = 16; // Example tile size, can be adjusted for specific hardware

    //#pragma scop

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (t = 0; t <= 39; t++) {

        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}

        #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}

        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
        for (ii = 1; ii <= 118; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
            for (jj = 1; jj <= 118; jj += TILE_SIZE) {

                #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
                for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i <= 118; i++) {
                    for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j <= 118; j++) {
                        A[i][j] = (A[i - 1][j - 1] + A[i - 1][j] + A[i - 1][j + 1] + A[i][j - 1] + A[i][j] + A[i][j + 1] + A[i + 1][j - 1] + A[i + 1][j] + A[i + 1][j + 1]) / 9.0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    //#pragma endscop
}
// ### Rationale:
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: By applying loop tiling, we process the array `A` in smaller blocks of size `TILE_SIZE`. This can improve cache utilization as the working set of the array elements fits better into the cache, reducing cache misses. It also provides opportunities for parallel execution within tiles.
// - **Tile Size**: The `TILE_SIZE` is a parameter that can be tuned based on the specific hardware's cache size and architecture to achieve optimal performance.
// - **Pragmas**: The original pragmas for pipelining, tiling, and parallelism are preserved to ensure that the HLS tool can further optimize the tiled loops.
// 
// This transformation aims to balance the workload and improve data locality, potentially leading to higher performance on hardware accelerated platforms.
