// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // Loop permutation is applied to bring the innermost loop that can be parallelized effectively.
  // Loop distribution is used to separate the operations on C[i][j] *= beta and C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k]
  // to allow for more efficient pipelining and parallelization.

  int TILE_SIZE_I = 20; // Example tile size, should be tuned based on the target architecture
  int TILE_SIZE_J = 20; // Example tile size, should be tuned based on the target architecture
  int TILE_SIZE_K = 15; // Example tile size, should be tuned based on the target architecture

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 80; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 80; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {

#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
      for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_I && i < 80; i++) {
        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < 80; j++) {
          if (j <= i) {
            C[i][j] *= beta;
          }
        }
      }

      for (int kk = 0; kk < 60; kk += TILE_SIZE_K) {

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
        for (k = kk; k < kk + TILE_SIZE_K && k < 60; k++) {
          for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_I && i < 80; i++) {

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
            for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < 80; j++) {
              if (j <= i) {
                C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling:** This transformation is applied to both the `i` and `j` loops, as well as introducing it for the `k` loop. Tiling improves data locality by working on smaller sub-matrices that fit into the FPGA's on-chip memory, reducing the need for frequent memory accesses to off-chip memory. This is crucial for performance as memory bandwidth is often a bottleneck in high-performance computing applications.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation:** The order of loops is adjusted to bring the `k` loop outside in the second operation (`C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k]`). This is not directly applied in the transformed code above due to the nature of the algorithm, but the tiling implicitly changes the execution order, which can be seen as a form of permutation that benefits parallel execution.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution:** The original loop nest is split into two separate parts; one for scaling `C[i][j]` by `beta` and another for the addition of the product of `alpha`, `A[i][k]`, and `A[j][k]`. This allows for more efficient pipelining and parallelization since each part can be optimized independently.
// 
// 4. **Parallelization and Pipelining:** The `#pragma ACCEL` directives are kept from the original code to hint at the HLS tool for automatic parallelization and pipelining optimizations. These directives suggest to the HLS compiler that it should attempt to parallelize loops and pipeline operations where possible, based on the specified factors or automatically determined ones.
// 
// Each transformation aims to exploit the parallelism and memory hierarchy of the target FPGA architecture, leading to a potentially significant performance improvement over the original code when synthesized for an FPGA.
