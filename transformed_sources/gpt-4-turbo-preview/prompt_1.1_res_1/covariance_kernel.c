// Optimizing the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) involves applying several code transformations to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This is applied to interchange loop orders to improve data locality or to make a loop more amenable to parallelization or pipelining.
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique breaks down loops into smaller chunks or "tiles" to improve cache utilization and enable parallel execution of these smaller chunks.
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This involves splitting a loop that performs multiple operations into multiple loops, each performing a subset of the operations, to enable more fine-grained parallelism and pipelining.
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: The opposite of loop distribution, this combines multiple loops into a single loop when they have the same loop bounds and are independent, reducing loop overhead and improving data locality.
// 
// Given the initial code, we'll focus on improving parallelism and data locality without fundamentally changing the algorithm's correctness. Here's the transformed code:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_covariance(int m, int n, double float_n, double data[100][80], double cov[80][80], double mean[80])
{
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop to calculate mean
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    mean[j] = 0.0;
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=mean FACTOR=auto
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      mean[j] += data[i][j];
    }
    mean[j] /= float_n;
  }

  // Loop to subtract mean from data
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      data[i][j] -= mean[j];
    }
  }

  // Loop to calculate covariance
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    for (j = i; j < 80; j++) {
      cov[i][j] = 0.0;
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=cov FACTOR=auto
      for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
        cov[i][j] += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
      }
      cov[i][j] /= float_n - 1.0;
      cov[j][i] = cov[i][j];
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// - **Loop Permutation** is not explicitly applied here as the original loop order seems optimal for memory access patterns, especially considering the row-major order of C arrays.
// - **Loop Tiling** was considered but not applied due to the relatively small loop bounds (100 and 80), which likely fit well into cache without tiling. However, for larger datasets, tiling could be beneficial, especially for the nested loops calculating the covariance.
// - **Loop Distribution** was not needed as the original loops were already well-separated by their functionality (calculating mean, adjusting data, calculating covariance).
// - **Loop Fusion** was not applied as there were no adjacent loops performing operations that could be combined without affecting the algorithm's correctness or data dependencies.
// 
// The primary optimizations come from the use of `#pragma ACCEL` directives to hint at parallel execution and pipelining opportunities. The `FACTOR=auto` and `reduction` clauses are particularly important for informing the HLS tool about potential parallel reductions and letting it automatically determine the best factor for parallelism or tiling, given the target architecture's resources.
// 
// This transformed code aims to maintain the algorithm's correctness while providing hints to the HLS compiler to exploit parallelism and pipelining, potentially leading to a more efficient hardware implementation.
