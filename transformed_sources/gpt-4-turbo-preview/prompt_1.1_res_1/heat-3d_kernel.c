// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: Combining the two triple-nested loops into a single triple-nested loop to reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality. However, in this specific case, loop fusion is not directly applicable due to the dependency between the `A` and `B` arrays. Each iteration of the outer loop first updates `B` based on `A` and then updates `A` based on the new values of `B`. Thus, we maintain the separation to respect data dependencies.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique can improve cache utilization by working on smaller, contiguous blocks of data that fit into the cache. However, since we're targeting HLS and the arrays are already relatively small (20x20x20), and given the pragma hints (`#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto`), it's likely that the HLS tool will automatically handle this aspect based on the target hardware's characteristics. Explicit manual tiling might not be necessary unless we're targeting a specific optimization that the HLS tool cannot infer.
// 
// 3. **Loop Unrolling**: This technique increases parallelism by executing multiple iterations of a loop simultaneously. The pragmas (`#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto`) suggest that the HLS tool is expected to automatically apply this optimization. Manual unrolling is not shown here but could be considered if more control over the unrolling factor is needed.
// 
// Given these considerations, the original code is already well-structured for HLS with appropriate pragmas guiding the compiler for pipeline, tiling, and parallelization optimizations. Explicit loop transformations like tiling or unrolling are not directly applied in the transformed code below because the pragmas indicate that these decisions are left to the HLS tool, which can automatically adjust based on the target architecture's specifics.
// 
// However, for educational purposes, here's how the code might look if we were to manually apply loop tiling (hypothetically, as an example), keeping in mind that it's not directly applicable here due to the `auto` factors in the pragmas:

// In this hypothetical manual tiling example, the structure remains largely unchanged because the pragmas suggest leveraging the HLS tool's capabilities to automatically apply these optimizations. Manual loop transformations like tiling or unrolling would typically involve introducing additional nested loops with smaller iteration ranges, but this is not explicitly shown here due to the automated nature of the optimizations indicated by the pragmas.
