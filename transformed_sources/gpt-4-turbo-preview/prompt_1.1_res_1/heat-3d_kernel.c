// To optimize the provided code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Below, I present the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied.

      #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L3}
      for (k = 1; k < 20 - 1; k++) { // Loop permutation: swapping loop j and k

        for (j = 1; j < 20 - 1; j++) {
          B[i][j][k] = 0.125 * (A[i + 1][j][k] - 2.0 * A[i][j][k] + A[i - 1][j][k]) +
                       0.125 * (A[i][j + 1][k] - 2.0 * A[i][j][k] + A[i][j - 1][k]) +
                       0.125 * (A[i][j][k + 1] - 2.0 * A[i][j][k] + A[i][j][k - 1]) + A[i][j][k];
        }
      }
    }

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
    for (i = 1; i < 20 - 1; i++) {

      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L4}
      #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L4}
      for (k = 1; k < 20 - 1; k++) { // Loop permutation: swapping loop j and k

        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L5}
        for (j = 1; j < 20 - 1; j++) {
          A[i][j][k] = 0.125 * (B[i + 1][j][k] - 2.0 * B[i][j][k] + B[i - 1][j][k]) +
                       0.125 * (B[i][j + 1][k] - 2.0 * B[i][j][k] + B[i][j - 1][k]) +
                       0.125 * (B[i][j][k + 1] - 2.0 * B[i][j][k] + B[i][j][k - 1]) + B[i][j][k];

// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: The inner loops over `j` and `k` are permuted. This transformation can potentially improve data locality and cache utilization by accessing contiguous memory locations, which is beneficial on many architectures. Loop permutation is chosen based on the access patterns to `A` and `B` and how the data is laid out in memory.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: Although not explicitly implemented in the transformed code (due to the use of `auto` for tiling factors), loop tiling would be an effective strategy for this code. It can be applied to break down the loops into smaller chunks that fit into the cache, reducing memory access times and improving data locality. The `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto` hints at the compiler to automatically determine the tiling factors, which is useful when the optimal tiling size is not known a priori.
// 
// 3. **Pipeline and Parallelism Pragmas**: The existing pragmas for pipelining and parallelism (`#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` and `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL`) are retained. These pragmas instruct the HLS tool to attempt to pipeline the loops and exploit parallelism within the hardware constraints. The goal is to keep the hardware units as busy as possible, reducing idle times and improving overall throughput.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion/Distribution**: No loop fusion or distribution is applied here as the original code already has a clear separation of concerns, and fusing loops would not offer benefits without a deeper restructuring of the algorithm. Additionally, the computation patterns and data dependencies between `A` and `B` updates suggest keeping them in separate loops to avoid data hazards.
// 
// These transformations aim to optimize the code for HLS by improving parallel execution capabilities and enhancing data locality, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators.
