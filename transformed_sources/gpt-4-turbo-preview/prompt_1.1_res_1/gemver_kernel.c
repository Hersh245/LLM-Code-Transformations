// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latencies. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This technique can improve cache locality by processing data in smaller blocks. However, given the pragmas already suggest tiling and the specific factors are set to auto, indicating that the HLS tool will decide the tiling factors, explicit manual tiling might not be necessary unless we want to override the HLS tool's decisions.
// 
// 2. **Loop Unrolling**: This is implicitly suggested by the `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` with `FACTOR=auto`. Unrolling loops can increase the level of parallelism by executing multiple iterations of the loop simultaneously.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion**: This technique combines multiple loops that have the same loop bounds and are independent of each other into a single loop. It can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality. However, in this code, loops are already quite optimized for their specific tasks, and fusing them might not be straightforward without violating data dependencies.
// 
// 4. **Loop Permutation**: This technique changes the order of nested loops to improve data locality. For example, accessing data in the order it's laid out in memory can reduce cache misses.
// 
// Given the above considerations and the fact that the code already includes several pragmas for parallelization and optimization, let's focus on a transformation that could potentially enhance data locality and parallelism without conflicting with the existing pragmas. Note that without specific details on the target architecture or further profiling data, these transformations are somewhat speculative.
// 
// Here's an example of a transformation focusing on loop permutation for the second loop nest to optimize memory access patterns:

// In this transformation, we permuted the loops in the second major loop nest (`x[i] += beta * A[j][i] * y[j];`). This change aims to access `A[j][i]` in a pattern that might be more contiguous in memory, depending on the memory layout of `A`. However, the effectiveness of this transformation highly depends on the specific architecture and how the compiler and HLS tool manage memory.
// 
// Remember, these transformations should be tested and profiled in the target environment to ensure they provide the intended performance benefits, as their effectiveness can vary greatly depending on the specifics of the hardware and the compiler's ability to optimize code.
