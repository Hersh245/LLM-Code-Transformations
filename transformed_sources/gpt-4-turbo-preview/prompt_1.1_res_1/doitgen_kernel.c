// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's a version of the code with transformations applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(int nr, int nq, int np, double A[25][20][30], double C4[30][30], double sum[30]) {
  int r, q, p, s;

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
  for (r = 0; r < nr; r++) {
    for (q = 0; q < nq; q++) {

      // Initialize sum array to zero
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (p = 0; p < np; p++) {
        sum[p] = 0.0;
      }

      // Loop distribution: Separating the computation of sum and assignment to A
      // This allows for better pipelining and parallel execution
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
      for (p = 0; p < np; p++) {
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
        for (s = 0; s < np; s++) {
          sum[p] += A[r][q][s] * C4[s][p];
        }
      }

      // Loop fusion: Merging the assignment loop back could be considered,
      // but keeping them separate might benefit from the computation-communication overlap
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
      for (p = 0; p < np; p++) {
        A[r][q][p] = sum[p];
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion and Distribution**: Initially, the code computes `sum[p]` and updates `A[r][q][p]` in the same loop nest. By distributing these loops, we separate the computation of `sum[p]` from its usage in updating `A[r][q][p]`. This allows for better pipelining opportunities as the computation of `sum[p]` can be fully parallelized and pipelined before the update of `A[r][q][p]` begins.
// 
// 2. **Parallelism**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto` directive is used to hint at automatic parallelization of the loops where data dependencies allow. For the initialization of `sum[p]` and the final assignment to `A[r][q][p]`, there are no dependencies between iterations, making them ideal candidates for parallel execution.
// 
// 3. **Pipelining**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto` directive is applied to the outer loops to suggest that HLS should pipeline these loops. Pipelining allows for multiple iterations of the loop to be in different stages of execution simultaneously, improving throughput.
// 
// 4. **Loop Permutation**: Not explicitly performed here, but it's worth noting that loop order might be adjusted based on the access patterns to improve data locality. In this case, the original order seems reasonable given the memory access patterns.
// 
// 5. **Loop Tiling**: Not applied in this transformation as the provided code snippet and pragmas do not indicate a clear tiling opportunity without further information on the target architecture and memory hierarchy. Tiling can be beneficial for large datasets that do not fit into on-chip memory, but it requires careful consideration of tile sizes and data reuse.
// 
// These transformations aim to improve the performance of the code on hardware by increasing parallelism, improving data locality, and making efficient use of available resources. The exact impact of these transformations can vary depending on the target FPGA architecture and the specifics of the HLS toolchain.
