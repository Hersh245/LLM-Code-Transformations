// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we need to consider the goals of reducing memory access latency, increasing data reuse, and enabling parallel execution. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m, int n, double A[116][124], double x[124], double y[124], double tmp[116]) {
  int i, j;

  // Initialize y to 0
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
    y[i] = ((double)0);
  }

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

  // Loop distribution applied to separate the concerns of tmp and y updates
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    tmp[i] = 0.0;

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
    }
  }

  // Since tmp is computed for all i before being used, we can distribute the loops
  // This allows for better pipelining and parallelization opportunities
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Distribution**: The original code computes `tmp[i]` and updates `y[j]` within the same loop iteration. By distributing these loops, we separate the concerns of computing `tmp` and updating `y`. This separation allows for better optimization opportunities, such as parallelization and pipelining, because the computation of `tmp` is completed for all `i` before any updates to `y` are made. This ensures that when updating `y`, all necessary `tmp` values are already computed, allowing for more efficient parallel execution.
// 
// 2. **Parallelization Pragmas**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` with `reduction` is used to indicate that the loop can be executed in parallel with a reduction operation on `tmp` and `y`. The `FACTOR=auto` hints to the HLS tool that it should automatically determine the best factor for parallel execution. This is crucial for achieving high performance, as it enables concurrent execution of independent operations.
// 
// 3. **Pipeline Pragma**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` pragma is retained from the original code. Pipelining is a technique that allows for the overlapping of loop iterations, significantly speeding up the execution. The `auto` option suggests that the HLS tool should automatically manage the pipelining process.
// 
// 4. **Tiling Pragma**: Although not directly applied in the transformation due to the nature of the code, the `#pragma ACCEL TILE` pragma is kept for potential manual or automatic tiling optimizations by the HLS tool. Tiling can be beneficial for improving data locality and cache usage, but its application depends on the specific memory access patterns and hardware characteristics.
// 
// ### Conclusion:
// 
// The transformed code aims to optimize memory access patterns and computational efficiency for HLS by applying loop distribution and leveraging parallelization and pipelining pragmas. These transformations are designed to improve the performance of the code on hardware by increasing data reuse, reducing latency, and enabling concurrent execution of independent operations.
