// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The order of the loops has been changed from (r, q, p) to (p, q, r). This allows for better data locality and cache utilization as the innermost loop now operates on contiguous memory locations.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The pragma `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}` has been added to tile the outermost loop (p) to improve data reuse and reduce memory access latency. The same tiling factor has been applied to the middle loop (q) and innermost loop (r) to maintain the tiling structure.
// 3. Loop Distribution: The loops have been distributed in a way that the innermost loop (r) is now the most tightly nested loop. This helps in maximizing parallelism and pipelining opportunities.
// 4. Loop Fusion: The loops have been fused together to reduce loop overhead and improve performance by combining multiple iterations into a single iteration.
