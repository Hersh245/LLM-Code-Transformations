// Explanation of transformations:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The outer loop over `j` has been moved to the outermost level to enable better data reuse and locality. This helps in improving memory access patterns and can potentially increase parallelism.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The tiling pragma has been kept the same as it was in the original code, but the tiling now applies to the `j` loop instead of the `i` loop. This helps in breaking down the computation into smaller tiles that can fit into cache more efficiently.
// 3. Loop Distribution: The distribution of loops has been changed to distribute the `t` loop inside the `i` loop. This can help in exposing more parallelism and improving overall performance.
// 4. Loop Fusion: The `t` loop has been fused with the `i` loop to reduce loop overhead and improve parallelism. This can lead to better pipelining and resource utilization in the hardware accelerator.
