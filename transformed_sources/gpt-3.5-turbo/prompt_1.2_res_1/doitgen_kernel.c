// Explanation of transformations:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The loops have been permuted so that the loop over 'p' is the outermost loop. This allows for better memory access patterns as the innermost loops can be pipelined efficiently.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The original code already had loop tiling pragmas, but they were applied separately for each loop. Here, all three loops have been tiled together to improve data locality and reduce memory access overhead.
// 3. Loop Fusion: The loops over 'r' and 'q' have been fused together to create a single loop. This reduces loop overhead and improves pipelining efficiency.
