// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The loops have been permuted such that the loop iterating over 'j' is now the outer loop. This can help improve data locality and cache efficiency as the inner loop accesses elements of 'A' and 'x' in a contiguous manner.
// 2. Loop Distribution: The computation of 'tmp' values has been separated into its own loop, which is now parallelized. This can help in better utilizing the available hardware resources and improving performance.
// 3. Loop Fusion: The two loops iterating over 'i' have been fused into a single loop. This can reduce loop overhead and improve parallelism by combining the two loops into one.
