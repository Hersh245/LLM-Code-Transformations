// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The loops have been reordered so that the loop over 'p' is the outermost loop. This is done to improve data locality and take advantage of the pipelining capabilities of the hardware.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The original code already had loop tiling directives, but they have been combined into a single directive for all loops. This helps in optimizing memory access patterns and improving cache utilization.
// 3. Loop Fusion: The loops over 'r' and 'q' have been fused together to reduce loop overhead and improve parallelism. This allows for better pipelining and resource utilization in the hardware.
