// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The inner and outer loops have been swapped to improve data locality and cache utilization. This can potentially reduce memory access latency and improve performance.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The loops have been tiled to partition the computation into smaller tiles, which can help improve data reuse and parallelism. This can lead to better performance by reducing memory access overhead.
// 3. Loop Distribution: The computation has been distributed across the loops to allow for parallel execution of the inner loop iterations. This can help exploit parallelism in the hardware and improve overall performance.
// 4. Loop Fusion: The loops have been fused together to reduce loop overhead and improve data locality. This can lead to better performance by reducing the number of loop iterations and improving cache efficiency.
