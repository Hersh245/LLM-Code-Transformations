// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Tiling: We have applied loop tiling to the outermost loops over 'r' and 'c' by adding `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}` and `#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}` respectively. This helps in improving data locality and reducing memory access overhead by breaking down the computation into smaller tiles that fit into cache more efficiently.
// 2. Loop Permutation: We have not applied loop permutation as the original code already has the loops in the order that maximizes data locality.
// 3. Loop Distribution: We have not applied loop distribution as the loops are already distributed across different levels of the code, and further distribution may not provide significant optimization.
// 4. Loop Fusion: We have not applied loop fusion as the loops are already fused at the innermost level for calculating the stencil operation, and further fusion may not be beneficial in this case.
