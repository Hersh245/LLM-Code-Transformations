// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The loops have been reordered so that the initialization of `y` is now parallelized before the main computation loops. This can help improve data locality and reduce loop-carried dependencies.
// 
// 2. Loop Tiling: The tiling pragma has been added to enable loop tiling, which partitions the loops into smaller tiles to improve data reuse and cache efficiency.
// 
// 3. Loop Distribution: The computation of `tmp` has been separated into its own parallel loop, which can help increase parallelism and reduce dependencies between iterations.
// 
// 4. Loop Fusion: The computation of `y` has been fused into a single loop over `j` and `i`, which can help reduce loop overhead and improve performance by combining multiple loops into one.
