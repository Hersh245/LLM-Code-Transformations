// Based on the performance estimates provided, we can optimize the code by applying loop tiling and loop permutation to improve the performance metrics such as accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC).
// 
// 1. Loop Tiling:
//    - We can tile the loop_j to improve data locality and reduce memory access overhead.
//    - By tiling the loop_j, we can process a smaller chunk of data at a time, which can lead to better cache utilization and reduced memory access latency.
// 
// 2. Loop Permutation:
//    - We can permute the loop_i and loop_j to optimize the loop execution order and improve parallelism.
//    - By permuting the loops, we can potentially increase the degree of parallelism and reduce the overall execution time.
// 
// Here is the transformed code with loop tiling and loop permutation:
