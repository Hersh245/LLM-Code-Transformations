// Based on the performance estimates provided, we can optimize the code by applying loop permutation, loop tiling, and loop fusion to improve the trip count (TC), accumulated cycles (AC), and cycles per call (CPC).
// 
// 1. Loop Permutation:
//    - Rationale: By permuting the loops, we can potentially improve data locality and reduce memory access overhead.
//    
// 2. Loop Tiling:
//    - Rationale: Tiling can help improve data reuse and reduce memory access latency by breaking down the computation into smaller tiles that fit into cache more efficiently.
//    
// 3. Loop Fusion:
//    - Rationale: Fusion can reduce loop overhead and improve parallelism by combining multiple loops into a single loop.
// 
// Here is the transformed code with the applied optimizations:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

// By permuting the loops, tiling the outer loop, and fusing the inner loops, we have optimized the code to potentially improve data locality, data reuse, and reduce memory access overhead. This should result in better performance in terms of TC, AC, and CPC based on the provided performance estimates.
