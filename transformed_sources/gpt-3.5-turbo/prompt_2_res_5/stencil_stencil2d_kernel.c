// Based on the performance estimates provided, we can optimize the code by applying loop tiling and loop permutation transformations to improve the overall performance.
// 
// 1. Loop Tiling:
// We can apply loop tiling to the outermost loop (stencil_label1) to improve data locality and reduce memory access overhead. By tiling the loop, we can process smaller data chunks at a time, which can lead to better cache utilization and reduced memory latency.
// 
// 2. Loop Permutation:
// We can also apply loop permutation to reorder the nested loops (stencil_label2 and stencil_label3) to optimize the pipeline efficiency. By rearranging the loop order, we can potentially increase the parallelism and reduce pipeline stalls.
// 
// Here is the transformed code with loop tiling and loop permutation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void stencil(int orig[8192], int sol[8192], int filter[9])
{
  int r;
  int c;
  int k1;
  int k2;
  int temp;
  int mul;
  
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  stencil_label1:
  for (r = 0; r < 128 - 2; r+=2) {
    
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
    
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    stencil_label3:
    for (k1 = 0; k1 < 3; k1++) {
      stencil_label2:
      for (c = 0; c < 64 - 2; c+=2) {
        temp = ((int)0);
        
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
        stencil_label4:
        for (k2 = 0; k2 < 3; k2++) {
          mul = filter[k1 * 3 + k2] * orig[(r + k1) * 64 + c + k2];
          temp += mul;
        }
        sol[r * 64 + c] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
}
// In the transformed code:
// - We have applied loop tiling to the outermost loop (stencil_label1) by incrementing the loop index 'r' by 2 in each iteration.
// - We have also applied loop permutation by reordering the nested loops (stencil_label2 and stencil_label3) to optimize the pipeline efficiency.
// 
// These transformations aim to improve data locality, reduce memory access overhead, and enhance pipeline efficiency, which can lead to better performance in terms of trip count, accumulated cycles, and cycles per call.
