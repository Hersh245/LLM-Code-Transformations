// Based on the performance estimates provided, we can optimize the code by applying loop tiling and loop permutation to improve the performance metrics such as accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC).
// 
// 1. Loop Tiling:
//    - We can tile the outer loop (loop i) to improve data locality and reduce memory access overhead.
//    - Tiling factor can be determined based on the cache size and the performance estimates.
// 
// 2. Loop Permutation:
//    - We can permute the order of loops to optimize the data access patterns and improve parallelism.
//    - By permuting the loops, we can potentially reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC).
// 
// Here is the transformed code with loop tiling and loop permutation:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m, int n, double A[116][124], double x[124], double y[124], double tmp[116])
{
  int i;
  int j;
//#pragma scop
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) 
    y[i] = ((double)0);
  
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=8{__TILE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i+=8) {
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      tmp[i] = 0.0;
      
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
      for (int ii = i; ii < i+8; ii++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
          tmp[ii] += A[ii][j] * x[j];
        }
      }
      
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
      for (int ii = i; ii < i+8; ii++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
          y[j] += A[ii][j] * tmp[ii];
        }
      }
    }

// In the transformed code:
// - We have applied loop tiling with a factor of 8 to the outer loop (loop i) to improve data locality and reduce memory access overhead.
// - We have also permuted the loops to optimize the data access patterns and potentially reduce the accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC).
// 
// These transformations aim to improve the performance of the code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) by optimizing the memory access patterns and increasing parallelism.
