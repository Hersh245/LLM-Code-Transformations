// Based on the performance estimate, we can see that the loop_j has a high CPC value, indicating that it might be a bottleneck in the code. To optimize the code, we can apply loop tiling to improve data locality and reduce the number of memory accesses. We can also apply loop permutation to potentially improve parallelism and reduce dependencies.

// In the transformed code:
// - We applied loop tiling with a factor of 16 to the outer loop_j. This will group iterations of the outer loop into tiles of size 16, improving data locality and reducing memory accesses.
// - We applied loop permutation to switch the order of the loops, with the inner loop_i now inside the outer loop_j. This can potentially improve parallelism and reduce dependencies, leading to better performance.
// 
// These transformations aim to optimize the code for HLS by improving data locality, reducing memory accesses, and potentially increasing parallelism. The impact of these transformations on the trip count, accumulated cycles, and cycles per call should be evaluated through synthesis and performance analysis tools to confirm the performance improvements.
