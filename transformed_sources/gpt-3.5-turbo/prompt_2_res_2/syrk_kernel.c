// Based on the performance estimates provided, we can optimize the code by applying loop tiling and loop permutation to improve the performance metrics such as accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC).
// 
// 1. Loop Tiling:
// We can apply loop tiling to the outer loop 'i' to improve data locality and reduce memory access overhead. By tiling the loop, we can process smaller chunks of data at a time, which can lead to better cache utilization and reduced memory access latency.
// 
// 2. Loop Permutation:
// We can also apply loop permutation to reorder the loops for better parallelism and pipelining. By rearranging the loops, we can exploit more parallelism opportunities and reduce pipeline stalls, leading to improved performance.
// 
// Here is the transformed code with loop tiling and loop permutation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60])
{
  int i;
  int j;
  int k;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i+=4) { // Loop Tiling applied with tile size of 4

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      if (j <= i) {
        C[i][j] *= beta;
      }
    }

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}

#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (k = 0; k < 60; k++) {

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
      for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
        if (j <= i) {
          for (int ii = i; ii < i+4; ii++) { // Loop Permutation applied for better parallelism
            C[ii][j] += alpha * A[ii][k] * A[j][k];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// By applying loop tiling with a tile size of 4 and loop permutation, we aim to reduce memory access overhead, improve parallelism, and enhance pipelining efficiency. These transformations should help optimize the code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and improve the overall performance metrics such as accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC).
