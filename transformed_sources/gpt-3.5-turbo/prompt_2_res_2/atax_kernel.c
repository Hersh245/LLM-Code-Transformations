// Based on the performance estimates provided, we can optimize the code by applying loop tiling and loop permutation transformations to improve the trip count (TC), accumulated cycles (AC), and cycles per call (CPC).
// 
// 1. Loop Tiling:
//    - We can apply loop tiling to the outer loop (loop i) to improve data locality and reduce memory access overhead.
//    - By tiling the loop, we can process smaller chunks of data at a time, which can improve cache utilization and reduce the number of memory accesses.
// 
// 2. Loop Permutation:
//    - We can also apply loop permutation to change the order of nested loops to optimize data access patterns and improve parallelism.
//    - By permuting the loops, we can potentially increase parallelism and reduce loop-carried dependencies.
// 
// Here is the transformed code with loop tiling and loop permutation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m, int n, double A[116][124], double x[124], double y[124], double tmp[116])
{
  int i;
  int j;
//#pragma scop
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) 
    y[i] = ((double)0);

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=16{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=16{__TILE__L1}

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=4{__PARA__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=4{__PARA__L1}
  for (int i_outer = 0; i_outer < 116; i_outer += 16) {
    for (int j_outer = 0; j_outer < 124; j_outer += 16) {
      
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=4{__PARA__L0_0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=4{__PARA__L0_1}
      for (i = i_outer; i < i_outer + 16; i++) {
        tmp[i] = 0.0;
        
        for (j = j_outer; j < j_outer + 16; j++) {
          tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        
        for (j = j_outer; j < j_outer + 16; j++) {
          y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
        }
      }
    }
  }
//#pragma endscop
}
// In the transformed code:
// - We have applied loop tiling with a tile factor of 16 to both dimensions of the loop to process data in smaller chunks.
// - We have also applied loop permutation to change the order of nested loops to optimize data access patterns and improve parallelism.
// - These transformations aim to improve data locality, increase parallelism, and reduce memory access overhead, leading to better performance in terms of TC, AC, and CPC.
