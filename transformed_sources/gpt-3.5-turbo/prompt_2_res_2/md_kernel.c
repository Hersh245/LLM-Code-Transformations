// Based on the performance estimates provided, we can optimize the code by applying loop tiling and loop permutation transformations to improve the performance metrics such as accumulated cycles (AC) and cycles per call (CPC).
// 
// 1. Loop Tiling:
//    By tiling the loops, we can improve data locality and reduce memory accesses, which can lead to better performance. We will tile the loop_j with a factor of 4.
// 
// 2. Loop Permutation:
//    By permuting the loops, we can optimize the order of loop execution to maximize parallelism and reduce dependencies. We will permute the loop_i and loop_j.
// 
// Here is the transformed code with loop tiling and loop permutation:
