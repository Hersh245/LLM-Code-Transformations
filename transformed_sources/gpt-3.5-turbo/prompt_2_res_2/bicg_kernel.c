// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The inner and outer loops have been swapped to improve data locality and cache efficiency. This allows for better memory access patterns and potentially reduces cache misses.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The outer loop has been tiled to split the computation into smaller chunks, which can improve data reuse and parallelism. This can lead to better pipelining and resource utilization.
// 3. Loop Distribution: The computation of `s[j]` has been distributed across the outer loop to utilize parallelism and improve performance. This can help in better utilizing the available hardware resources.
// 4. Loop Fusion: There was no explicit loop fusion performed in this transformation as it was not necessary for optimizing the given code.
