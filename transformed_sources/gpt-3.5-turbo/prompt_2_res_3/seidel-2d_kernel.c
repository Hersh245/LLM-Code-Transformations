// Explanation of transformations:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The original code had loops iterating in the order t, i, j. By permuting the loops to iterate in the order j, t, i, we can take advantage of loop tiling and parallelism more effectively.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The original code did not have explicit loop tiling. By adding tiling pragmas, we can partition the iteration space into smaller tiles, which can improve data locality and reduce memory access latency.
// 3. Loop Distribution: The original code had a single loop nest with three levels of iteration. By distributing the loops and adding parallel pragmas, we can increase parallelism and potentially improve performance.
// 4. Loop Fusion: In this case, loop fusion was not applied as it was not necessary for optimizing the code.
