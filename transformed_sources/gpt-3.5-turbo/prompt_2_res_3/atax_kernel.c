// Based on the performance estimates provided, we can optimize the code by applying loop tiling and loop permutation to improve the overall performance. 
// 
// Here is the transformed code with loop tiling and loop permutation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(int m, int n, double A[116][124], double x[124], double y[124], double tmp[116])
{
  int i;
  int j;
//#pragma scop
  for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) 
    y[i] = ((double)0);
  
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=16,16{__TILE__L0}
  
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 116; i+=16) {
    for (j = 0; j < 124; j+=16) {
      for (int ii = i; ii < i + 16; ii++) {
        tmp[ii] = 0.0;
        
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_0}
        for (int jj = j; jj < j + 16; jj++) {
          tmp[ii] += A[ii][jj] * x[jj];
        }
        
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0_1}
        for (int jj = j; jj < j + 16; jj++) {
          y[jj] += A[ii][jj] * tmp[ii];

// ### Rationale for Transformation:
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: By tiling the loops with a factor of 16x16, we can improve data locality and reduce cache misses, leading to better performance. This helps in utilizing the cache effectively and reducing the memory access overhead.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: By permuting the loops to iterate over tiles of data, we can increase parallelism and exploit the available hardware resources more efficiently. This can lead to better pipelining and reduced cycle count, as evident from the performance estimates. 
// 
// By applying these transformations, we aim to optimize the code for HLS to achieve better performance in terms of reduced cycle count and improved cycles per call.
