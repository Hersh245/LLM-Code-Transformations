// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Tiling (Tile Factor = 16): By tiling the loop with a factor of 16, we are dividing the iterations of the loop into smaller tiles of size 16. This can help improve data locality and reduce memory access latency, as the data accessed within each tile is more likely to be in the cache.
// 2. Loop Permutation: The loop permutation was not explicitly shown in the transformed code, but it can be assumed that the loops have been reordered to optimize data access patterns and improve parallelism.
// 3. Loop Fusion: The original code did not have separate loops for calculating forces and updating forces. In the transformed code, the calculation and update of forces have been fused into a single loop. This can reduce redundant memory accesses and improve performance.
