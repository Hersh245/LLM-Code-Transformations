// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The innermost loop (previously over 'j') has been moved to the outermost position, and the loop over 'i' is now the middle loop. This is done to improve data locality and cache efficiency as the inner loop now accesses contiguous memory locations in the 'j' direction.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The loop over 'j' has been tiled to process data in smaller chunks, which can help improve memory access patterns and reduce cache misses.
// 3. Loop Distribution: The loop over 'i' has been distributed across the 'j' loop to enable parallel processing of different 'i' values within each 'j' iteration. This can help exploit parallelism in the hardware and improve performance.
// 4. Loop Fusion: Since the loops are now in a different order, loop fusion is not applicable in this case.
