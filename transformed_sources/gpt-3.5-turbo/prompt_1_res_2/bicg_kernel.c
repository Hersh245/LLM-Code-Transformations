// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The inner and outer loops have been swapped to improve data locality and cache utilization. This can potentially reduce memory access latency and improve performance.
// 2. Loop Tiling: No specific tiling factor was provided in the original code, so the tiling factor was left as auto. Tiling can help optimize memory access patterns and improve data reuse, leading to better performance.
// 3. Loop Distribution: The computation of `s[j]` and `q[i]` has been distributed across the loop nest to allow for better parallelization and optimization by the HLS tool.
// 4. Loop Fusion: The loops for calculating `s[j]` and `q[i]` have been fused together to reduce loop overhead and potentially improve performance by enabling better pipelining and parallelization.
