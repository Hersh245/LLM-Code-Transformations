// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latencies. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_symm(double alpha, double beta, double C[200][240], double A[200][200], double B[200][240]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and cache usage.
  // It can also help in better utilization of parallel hardware resources.
  // The tile sizes (TILE_SIZE_I, TILE_SIZE_J, TILE_SIZE_K) are to be defined based on the target architecture's characteristics.
  #define TILE_SIZE_I 10
  #define TILE_SIZE_J 12
  #define TILE_SIZE_K 10

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 200; i += TILE_SIZE_I) {

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (j = 0; j < 240; j += TILE_SIZE_J) {
      
      // Loop distribution applied here to separate the two innermost loops.
      // This helps in applying different optimizations (like parallelism) more effectively to each loop.
      for (int ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE_I && ii < 200; ++ii) {
        for (int jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE_J && jj < 240; ++jj) {
          double tmp = B[ii][jj];
          for (k = 0; k < ii; ++k) {
            C[k][jj] += alpha * tmp * A[ii][k];
          }
        }
      }

      for (int ii = i; ii < i + TILE_SIZE_I && ii < 200; ++ii) {
        for (int jj = j; jj < j + TILE_SIZE_J && jj < 240; ++jj) {
          double temp2 = 0.0;
          for (k = 0; k < ii; ++k) {
            temp2 += B[k][jj] * A[ii][k];
          }
          C[ii][jj] = beta * C[ii][jj] + alpha * B[ii][jj] * A[ii][ii] + alpha * temp2;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is applied to the `i` and `j` loops to improve data locality by processing the data in smaller blocks that fit better in cache. This can significantly reduce the memory access time for large matrices. The choice of tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I`, `TILE_SIZE_J`, `TILE_SIZE_K`) depends on the specific architecture and should be tuned for optimal performance.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: The original code had a nested loop structure where different operations were performed in the innermost loop. By distributing the loops, we separate different computations into distinct loop nests. This allows for more focused optimizations on each loop nest, such as better pipelining and parallelization opportunities. Specifically, it separates the computation of `C[k][j]` updates from the computation of `C[i][j]` updates, allowing each to be optimized independently.
// 
// 3. **Parallelism Pragmas**: The original pragmas are maintained to hint at the compiler for automatic parallelization, pipelining, and tiling. These pragmas suggest to the HLS tool that it should attempt to automatically determine the best factor for parallelism, pipelining, and tiling based on the provided code structure and target architecture capabilities.
// 
// ### Note:
// - The choice of tile sizes is crucial for performance and must be tailored to the target hardware's specific characteristics, such as cache sizes and memory bandwidth.
// - Further optimizations might include exploring different loop orders (loop interchange) for better memory access patterns or integrating more advanced techniques like software prefetching, depending on the target architecture's capabilities and the specific requirements of the application.
