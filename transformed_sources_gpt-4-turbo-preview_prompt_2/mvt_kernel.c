// To optimize the provided C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we need to focus on improving data locality, parallelism, and reducing memory access latencies. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_mvt(double x1[120], double x2[120], double y_1[120], double y_2[120], double A[120][120])
{
  int i, j, ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 30; // Assuming a tile size of 30 for demonstration. This can be adjusted based on the target architecture and memory bandwidth.
  
  //#pragma scop
  
  // Loop tiling applied to both loops to improve cache locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // This can help in reducing the memory access times for A, x1, and x2.
  
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=x1 FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
      for (i = ii; i < ((ii + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (ii + TILE_SIZE) : 120); i++) {
        for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (jj + TILE_SIZE) : 120); j++) {
          x1[i] += A[i][j] * y_1[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
  for (ii = 0; ii < 120; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (jj = 0; jj < 120; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=x2 FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
      for (i = ii; i < ((ii + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (ii + TILE_SIZE) : 120); i++) {
        for (j = jj; j < ((jj + TILE_SIZE) < 120 ? (jj + TILE_SIZE) : 120); j++) {
          x2[i] += A[j][i] * y_2[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }
  //#pragma endscop
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is applied to both the `x1` and `x2` computation loops. Loop tiling, also known as loop blocking, helps in breaking down the loops into smaller blocks. This can significantly improve cache utilization by ensuring that the working set of data fits into the cache, reducing the number of cache misses and thus the memory access latency. It also opens up opportunities for parallel execution within tiles.
// 
// 2. **Parallelism**: The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` directive hints at the compiler to parallelize the inner loops. The use of reduction variables (`x1` and `x2`) is specified to ensure that the compiler can safely parallelize the accumulation operations. The `FACTOR=auto` directive allows the HLS tool to automatically determine the optimal parallelism factor based on the target architecture and available resources.
// 
// 3. **Pipeline**: The `#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE` directive is used to enable loop pipelining, a technique that allows for the overlap of loop iterations. This can significantly increase the throughput of the loops by executing different stages of multiple iterations in parallel. The `auto` parameter lets the HLS tool decide the best way to pipeline the operations for maximum performance.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is optimized for HLS, potentially leading to higher performance and more efficient use of hardware resources when synthesized to an FPGA or other hardware accelerators.
