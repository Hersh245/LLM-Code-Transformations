// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using transformations like loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we need to focus on improving data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation can help in improving data locality and cache usage by processing data in smaller blocks. However, given the pragma hints (`#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto`), it seems the intention is to let the HLS tool decide the tiling factor automatically. For educational purposes, we'll explicitly introduce tiling, but in practice, the HLS tool's auto factor might be more efficient.
// 
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: This technique combines two separate loops that have the same loop index range into a single loop. It can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality. However, in this case, loop fusion is not directly applicable because the two loops have dependencies between them (the second loop depends on the results of the first loop).
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: This technique changes the order of nested loops to improve data locality or parallelism. In this code, loop permutation might not directly benefit due to the nature of dependencies between iterations.
// 
// 4. **Loop Distribution**: This technique splits a loop into multiple loops over the same range but with different bodies, to improve parallelism or to separate concerns. It's not directly applicable here as the loops are already doing distinct work.
// 
// Given these considerations, let's focus on applying loop tiling explicitly for educational purposes, while keeping in mind the automatic optimization hints already provided in the code. We'll introduce a tiling factor `TILE_SIZE`, but remember, in a real scenario, the HLS tool's auto factor might be preferable.

// **Rationale Behind Transformations**:
// 
// - **Explicit Loop Tiling**: Although the original code suggests using automatic tiling, explicitly defining tiling can provide more control over memory access patterns and cache usage, potentially leading to better performance on specific hardware.
// - **Maintained Original Pragmas**: The original pragmas for pipeline, tiling, and parallel factors are kept to allow the HLS tool to further optimize the code automatically based on the specific hardware targets.
// 
// Remember, the effectiveness of these transformations can vary based on the target hardware and the specific HLS tool being used. It's always beneficial to experiment with different strategies and consult the HLS tool's documentation and performance analysis features.
