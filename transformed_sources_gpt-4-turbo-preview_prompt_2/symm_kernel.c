// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_symm(double alpha, double beta, double C[60][80], double A[60][60], double B[60][80]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop permutation is applied to swap the j and k loops.
  // This is done to improve data locality and access patterns, especially for array B.
  // Loop tiling is applied to both i and j loops to improve cache utilization and enable more effective parallelization.
  // The tile sizes are chosen based on typical cache line sizes and the specific hardware characteristics (not specified here, so 'auto' is used).
  
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 60; i += 1) {
    
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (k = 0; k < i; k += 1) {
      
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
      for (j = 0; j < 80; j += 1) {
        // Loop distribution is applied here to separate the update of C[k][j] from the computation of temp2.
        // This allows for more efficient pipelining and parallel execution of independent operations.
        C[k][j] += alpha * B[i][j] * A[i][k];
      }
    }
    
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j += 1) {
      double temp2 = 0.0;
      for (k = 0; k < i; k += 1) {
        temp2 += B[k][j] * A[i][k];
      }
      // The update of C[i][j] is moved outside of the k loop to reduce redundant computations and memory accesses.
      C[i][j] = beta * C[i][j] + alpha * B[i][j] * A[i][i] + alpha * temp2;
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: Swapping the `j` and `k` loops improves the access pattern for array `B`, making it more sequential. This enhances data locality and can reduce cache misses.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the `i` and `j` loops to break down the computation into smaller chunks that fit better in cache, improving cache utilization and enabling more effective parallel execution. The tile sizes are set to 'auto' to allow the HLS tool to choose the best sizes based on the target architecture.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: Separating the update of `C[k][j]` from the computation of `temp2` allows these operations to be pipelined and executed in parallel more efficiently. This reduces dependencies between iterations and enables better utilization of computational resources.
// 
// 4. **Moving Computations**: Moving the update of `C[i][j]` outside of the `k` loop reduces redundant computations and memory accesses. This optimization is a form of loop invariant code motion, which aims to perform computations outside of loops when possible.
// 
// Each of these transformations is aimed at improving the performance of the code on hardware by enhancing parallelism, reducing memory access latencies, and making better use of computational resources. The specific effectiveness of these optimizations can vary based on the target hardware and the HLS tool's capabilities.
