// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency. Here's a transformed version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_trmm(double alpha, double A[60][60], double B[60][80])
{
  // Loop interchange is applied to bring the k loop to the outermost position
  // This is done to exploit temporal locality and improve data reuse for array A
  // Loop tiling is also applied to both i and j loops to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory
  
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (int k = 0; k < 60; k++) {
    
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=16{__TILE__L1} // Example tiling factor, adjust based on target architecture
    
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (int i = 0; i < 60; i += 16) { // Tiled loop for i
      
      #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
      
      #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=20{__TILE__L2} // Example tiling factor, adjust based on target architecture
      
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
      for (int j = 0; j < 80; j += 20) { // Tiled loop for j
        
        // Innermost loops iterate over the tile
        for (int ii = i; ii < i + 16 && ii < 60; ii++) {
          
          for (int jj = j; jj < j + 20 && jj < 80; jj++) {
            
            if (k > ii) {
              B[ii][jj] += A[k][ii] * B[k][jj];
            }
            
            // Moved the scaling of B[ii][jj] by alpha outside the k-loop
            // This avoids redundant multiplications by alpha
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Scaling B by alpha is moved here to be done once per k-loop iteration
    // This is more efficient than doing it inside the innermost loop
    if (k == 59) { // Ensure we only scale by alpha after the last update
      for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
          B[i][j] = alpha * B[i][j];
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Interchange**: Moving the `k` loop to the outermost position allows for better temporal locality, especially for accesses to array `A`. This is because, for each `k`, the same elements of `A` are reused across iterations of `i` and `j`.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the `i` and `j` loops to improve data locality. By working on smaller sub-matrices (tiles) at a time, this transformation aims to make better use of the cache, reducing memory bandwidth requirements.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion/Distribution**: Not directly applied here, but the restructuring of the loops and the movement of the scaling operation (`B[i][j] = alpha * B[i][j]`) outside of the `k` loop can be seen as a form of loop optimization that reduces the number of operations performed.
// 
// 4. **Parallelism and Pipeline Pragmas**: These are retained from the original code to hint at the compiler for potential parallel execution and pipelining opportunities. The specific factors and settings should be tuned based on the target architecture and the HLS tool being used.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is better structured for HLS tools to exploit parallelism and pipeline operations more efficiently, while also improving data locality and reducing unnecessary computations.
