// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and efficient use of resources, such as memory bandwidth and computational units. The transformations include loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, and potentially loop fusion if applicable. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: We switch the loop order of `j` and `k` to improve data locality. Accessing `B[k][j]` in the innermost loop is more efficient due to continuous memory access patterns.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique breaks the loops into smaller chunks, improving cache utilization and enabling parallel execution of chunks. We apply tiling to both the `i` and `j` loops for better data locality and parallelism.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: This technique is applied to separate different computations within a loop. However, in this case, the loop's operations are already well-structured for parallel execution, so we might not apply this explicitly.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: Not directly applicable here, as we aim to separate concerns (scaling `C` by `beta` and the computation of `C += alpha * A * B`) for clarity and efficiency.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gemm(int ni, int nj, int nk, double alpha, double beta, double C[200][220], double A[200][240], double B[240][220]) {
    int i, j, k;
    int ii, jj, kk;
    int TILE_SIZE_I = 10; // Example tile size, should be tuned based on actual hardware
    int TILE_SIZE_J = 11; // Example tile size, should be tuned based on actual hardware
    int TILE_SIZE_K = 12; // Example tile size, should be tuned based on actual hardware

    // Loop Tiling for i and j loops
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
    for (ii = 0; ii < 200; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
        for (jj = 0; jj < 220; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {
            // Scaling C by beta
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
            for (i = ii; i < min(ii + TILE_SIZE_I, 200); i++) {
                for (j = jj; j < min(jj + TILE_SIZE_J, 220); j++) {
                    C[i][j] *= beta;
                }
            }

            // Computation of C += alpha * A * B
            for (kk = 0; kk < 240; kk += TILE_SIZE_K) {
                #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
                for (i = ii; i < min(ii + TILE_SIZE_I, 200); i++) {
                    for (k = kk; k < min(kk + TILE_SIZE_K, 240); k++) {
                        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto
                        for (j = jj; j < min(jj + TILE_SIZE_J, 220); j++) {
                            C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// **Rationale behind transformations:**
// 
// - **Loop Permutation**: By accessing `B[k][j]` in the innermost loop, we ensure that memory access patterns are more sequential, which is beneficial for cache utilization.
// - **Loop Tiling**: Breaking the computation into smaller chunks (tiles) allows for better cache locality and can help in parallelizing the computation of these chunks. It's crucial to choose appropriate tile sizes based on the target architecture's cache size and other resources.
// - **Loop Distribution and Fusion**: These techniques were considered but not explicitly applied in the transformed code. The original loop structure was already conducive to parallel execution, and our focus was on improving data locality and parallelism through loop permutation and tiling.
// 
// This transformed code aims to better utilize the hardware resources available in an HLS context, potentially leading to higher throughput and lower latency due to improved parallelism and data locality.
