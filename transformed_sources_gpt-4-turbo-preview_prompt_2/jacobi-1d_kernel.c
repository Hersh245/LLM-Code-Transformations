// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The original code iterates over arrays `A` and `B` to perform a series of updates based on neighboring values. The primary goal is to increase data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Fusion**: We'll avoid this as the two loops update `A` and `B` arrays in a way that requires the completion of all updates to `B` before starting updates to `A`. Fusing these loops would break this dependency and lead to incorrect results.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This transformation is not directly applicable here due to the small loop bounds and the nature of the computation, which already benefits from spatial locality. Additionally, tiling small loops can sometimes introduce overhead that outweighs its benefits.
// 
// 3. **Loop Unrolling**: This can be beneficial for HLS as it increases parallelism. The `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL` hints at this, but we'll explicitly mention it to clarify our intent. However, the code already specifies `FACTOR=auto`, which lets the HLS tool decide the unroll factor. Explicitly specifying a factor could be beneficial if we had more information about the target architecture.
// 
// 4. **Loop Distribution**: Not applicable here as we're not performing multiple independent operations within the same loop that could benefit from being separated.
// 
// Given the constraints and the nature of the code, the most significant improvements can come from ensuring that the compiler fully understands our intentions regarding parallelism and pipeline optimizations. Since the code already includes pragmas for pipeline and parallelism, and given the lack of opportunity for loop fusion, tiling, or distribution without changing the algorithm's nature, the best approach is to ensure that these pragmas are correctly placed and perhaps clarify our intentions regarding loop unrolling.
// 
// Here's the code with explicit loop unrolling hints added for clarity, assuming we're targeting a platform where such optimizations are beneficial:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_jacobi_1d(int tsteps, int n, double A[120], double B[120])
{
    int t;
    int i;
    //#pragma scop

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {

        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
        #pragma ACCEL UNROLL FACTOR=auto{__UNROLL__L1}
        for (i = 1; i < 120 - 1; i++) {
            B[i] = 0.33333 * (A[i - 1] + A[i] + A[i + 1]);
        }

        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
        #pragma ACCEL UNROLL FACTOR=auto{__UNROLL__L2}
        for (i = 1; i < 120 - 1; i++) {
            A[i] = 0.33333 * (B[i - 1] + B[i] + B[i + 1]);
        }
    }
    //#pragma endscop
}
// In this version, I've added `#pragma ACCEL UNROLL FACTOR=auto{__UNROLL__L1}` and `#pragma ACCEL UNROLL FACTOR=auto{__UNROLL__L2}` to explicitly suggest loop unrolling for both inner loops. This should encourage the HLS tool to explore parallelism within these loops more aggressively. The `FACTOR=auto` lets the HLS tool choose the unrolling factor based on its analysis, which is often the best choice without specific knowledge of the target architecture's capabilities.
