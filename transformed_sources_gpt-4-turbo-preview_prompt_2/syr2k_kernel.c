// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and the efficiency of memory access patterns, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syr2k(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60], double B[80][60]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // Tile sizes are chosen based on typical FPGA on-chip memory capacities and access patterns.
  // Adjust TILE_SIZE_I, TILE_SIZE_J, and TILE_SIZE_K as needed based on the target FPGA characteristics.
  const int TILE_SIZE_I = 10;
  const int TILE_SIZE_J = 10;
  const int TILE_SIZE_K = 15;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  // Loop tiling for the 'i' and 'j' loops
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 80; ii += TILE_SIZE_I) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj < 80; jj += TILE_SIZE_J) {
      
      // Loop distribution is applied here to separate the operations on C[i][j] for better parallelism and pipelining
      // Scale C[i][j] by beta
      for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_I && i < 80; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < 80; j++) {
          if (j <= i) {
            C[i][j] *= beta;
          }
        }
      }

      // Update C[i][j] based on A and B matrices
      for (k = 0; k < 60; k += TILE_SIZE_K) {
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}

#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}

#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
        for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE_I && i < 80; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
          for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE_J && j < 80; j++) {
            if (j <= i) {
              for (int kk = k; kk < k + TILE_SIZE_K && kk < 60; kk++) {
                C[i][j] += A[j][kk] * alpha * B[i][kk] + B[j][kk] * alpha * A[i][kk];
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** This transformation is applied to the `i`, `j`, and `k` loops to improve data locality by processing the data in smaller blocks that fit into the FPGA's fast on-chip memory. This reduces the latency associated with accessing data from off-chip memory and can significantly speed up the computation.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution:** The original loop over `j` that scales `C[i][j]` by `beta` and the loop that updates `C[i][j]` are separated. This allows for better pipelining and parallelization opportunities, as the scaling and updating operations have different data dependencies and can be optimized independently.
// 
// 3. **Parallelization and Pipelining Pragmas:** The original pragmas are retained and applied to the transformed loops to hint to the HLS tool about opportunities for parallel execution and pipelining. The HLS tool can automatically adjust the parallelization factors and pipeline depths based on the provided hints and the target FPGA architecture.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is better structured for parallel execution on an FPGA, with improved data locality and reduced memory access latency. The specific tile sizes (`TILE_SIZE_I`, `TILE_SIZE_J`, `TILE_SIZE_K`) should be tuned based on the target FPGA's resources and the specific requirements of the application.
