// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization, which can lead to better performance on FPGA or ASIC implementations. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void gemm(double m1[4096], double m2[4096], double prod[4096]) {
    int i, j, k;
    int k_col, i_col;
    double mult;

    // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and cache usage.
    // It can also help in creating smaller, more manageable chunks of computation for parallel execution.
    // The tile size is chosen based on typical cache sizes and the specifics of the target architecture.
    // Here, we assume a tile size of 16 for demonstration purposes, but this can be adjusted.
    int TILE_SIZE = 16;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
    outer:
    for (int ii = 0; ii < 64; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (int jj = 0; jj < 64; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
            for (int kk = 0; kk < 64; kk += TILE_SIZE) {

                // Loop permutation is applied here to interchange the loops for better memory access patterns.
                // This can help in achieving more sequential memory accesses and reduce cache misses.
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
                for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE; i++) {
                    for (k = kk; k < kk + TILE_SIZE; k++) {
                        i_col = i * 64;
                        k_col = k * 64;
                        mult = m1[i_col + k];

                        // Loop distribution is not directly applied here, but the restructuring of the loops
                        // and the tiling inherently distribute the work more evenly across iterations.
                        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE; j++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=sum FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
                            prod[i_col + j] += mult * m2[k_col + j];
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** This transformation breaks down the loops into smaller chunks or "tiles," improving data locality and cache usage. By processing data in smaller blocks, we ensure that the data used by the computation resides in the cache closer to the processor, reducing memory access times and improving overall performance.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation:** By interchanging the loops, we aim to optimize the memory access pattern. This can lead to more sequential memory accesses, which are faster than random accesses, thus reducing cache misses and improving performance.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution:** Although not directly applied in the transformed code, the restructuring and tiling of loops distribute the computational workload more evenly. This can help in parallelizing the computation more effectively, especially in the context of FPGA or ASIC implementations where parallel execution units can be synthesized.
// 
// 4. **Pragma Directives:** The original pragmas for pipeline, tile, and parallel are retained and applied to the transformed loops. These directives hint to the HLS tool to apply specific optimizations like pipelining (to overlap loop iterations), tiling (to manage data chunks efficiently), and parallel execution (to exploit data-level parallelism). The `auto` factor allows the HLS tool to automatically determine the optimal factor for each directive based on the target architecture and the specific loop characteristics.
// 
// By applying these transformations and optimizations, the code is better suited for HLS targeting FPGA or ASIC, potentially leading to higher performance and more efficient hardware utilization.
