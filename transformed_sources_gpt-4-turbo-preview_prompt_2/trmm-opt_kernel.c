// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC designs. Below, I present a transformed version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_trmm(double alpha, double A[60][60], double B[60][80]) {
  // BLAS parameters
  // SIDE = 'L'
  // UPLO = 'L'
  // TRANSA = 'T'
  // DIAG = 'U'
  // => Form B := alpha*A**T*B.
  // A is MxM
  // B is MxN

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

  double temp_B[60][80];
  // Copy B to temp_B to improve data locality
  for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      temp_B[i][j] = B[i][j];
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (int j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      double sum = temp_B[i][j];
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=sum FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
      for (int k = 0; k <= i; k++) { // Loop bounds changed to k <= i
        sum += A[i][k] * temp_B[k][j]; // Access pattern changed due to loop permutation
      }
      B[i][j] = alpha * sum;
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Data Copying for Improved Locality**: Before performing the computation, the original `B` matrix is copied into a temporary matrix `temp_B`. This step is crucial for improving data locality, as it ensures that the read operations on `B` during the computation do not interfere with the write operations, which can be particularly beneficial when exploiting temporal locality in FPGA/ASIC designs.
// 
// 2. **Loop Bounds Adjustment**: The innermost loop's bounds have been adjusted from `for (int k = 0; k < 60; k++)` to `for (int k = 0; k <= i; k++)`. This change eliminates unnecessary iterations where `k > i`, as the original condition `if (k > i)` inside this loop would always evaluate to false based on the new bounds. This adjustment reduces the number of iterations and hence the computational load.
// 
// 3. **Access Pattern Change**: Due to the loop bounds adjustment and the original intention to compute `alpha*A**T*B`, the access pattern to matrix `A` has been changed from `A[k][i]` to `A[i][k]`. This change aligns with the adjusted loop bounds and ensures that the computation reflects the correct matrix multiplication considering the transpose operation on `A`.
// 
// 4. **Maintaining Original Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been kept intact to ensure that the compiler's directives for pipeline optimization, tiling, and parallelism are preserved. These directives are crucial for guiding the HLS tool in exploiting parallelism and optimizing memory access patterns, which are essential for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is optimized for HLS, focusing on improving data locality, reducing unnecessary computations, and ensuring efficient use of hardware resources.
