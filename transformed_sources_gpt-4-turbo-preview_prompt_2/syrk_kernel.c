// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve data locality, parallelism, and reduce the number of redundant computations or memory accesses. Here's a step-by-step transformation of the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This is beneficial for improving cache locality and can be particularly effective for the inner loops that access array elements. However, given the pragmas already hint at tiling, we'll ensure our transformations respect potential auto-tiling optimizations.
// 
// 2. **Loop Fusion**: Combining loops that have the same loop bounds and are independent can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve data locality. However, in this case, the operations inside the loops are dependent (the first loop initializes `C` with `beta`, and the second updates `C` with `alpha` and `A`), making fusion not directly applicable without altering the computation's semantics.
// 
// 3. **Loop Permutation**: Changing the loop order can sometimes improve performance by enhancing data locality or enabling other optimizations. In this case, we might consider permuting the loops to bring computations closer together or align with memory access patterns better.
// 
// Given the structure of the code and the operations performed, the most direct optimizations while respecting the original pragmas and without altering the algorithm's semantics significantly are somewhat limited. However, let's attempt a minor reorganization for clarity and potential optimization:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_syrk(double alpha, double beta, double C[80][80], double A[80][60]) {
  int i, j, k;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
      C[i][j] *= beta;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
      for (k = 0; k < 60; k++) {
        C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
      }
    }
  }
}
// Rationale behind the transformation:
// 
// - **Loop Nesting Adjustment**: The adjustment here is minor and focuses on reducing the scope of the `j` loop to only iterate where necessary (`j <= i`). This does not fundamentally change the algorithm but makes the dependency and the triangular processing of `C` more explicit.
// - **Maintaining Pragmas**: All original pragmas have been kept in place. The intention is to respect the original directives for pipeline, tiling, and parallelization, assuming they were placed with specific hardware acceleration targets in mind.
// - **Loop Permutation or Fusion**: Direct loop permutation or fusion isn't applied here due to the nature of the computation and dependencies. The primary focus is on maintaining the algorithm's correctness while slightly adjusting loop bounds for clarity.
// 
// This transformation keeps the original computation's intent intact, respects the pragmas for potential hardware-specific optimizations, and slightly adjusts loop bounds for clarity and potentially minor efficiency gains. Further optimization could require more aggressive restructuring or algorithmic changes, which might not be feasible without additional context on the hardware target or without altering the computation's semantics.
