// To optimize the provided C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency. We'll focus on loop unrolling, loop tiling, and loop distribution as primary techniques. Note that the specific transformations and their effectiveness can depend on the target architecture and the HLS tool being used.
// 
// ### Original Code Overview
// The original code performs a generalized sum of matrix-vector multiplications (GESUMMV) with two matrices `A` and `B`, and a vector `x`, scaling the results with `alpha` and `beta` respectively before summing them into vector `y`. The inner loop calculates the matrix-vector product, and the outer loop iterates over the rows of the matrices.
// 
// ### Proposed Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Unrolling:** This increases the level of parallelism by executing multiple iterations of a loop simultaneously. It's particularly effective for the inner loop to reduce the latency of accessing elements in `A`, `B`, and `x`.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling:** This technique can improve cache locality by processing the matrix in smaller blocks. However, given the relatively small size of the matrices (90x90), and without specific cache size details, we might skip explicit tiling in favor of relying on the HLS tool's `auto` tiling capabilities, if applicable.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution:** This can be applied to separate the accumulation operations on `tmp` and `y` into different loops. However, in this case, it might not provide significant benefits due to the dependency on the results of `tmp` for computing `y`.
// 
// Given the context and the provided code, the most straightforward and impactful optimization would be loop unrolling for the inner loop. We'll assume the HLS tool can handle tiling and other optimizations automatically when set to `auto`.
// 
// ### Transformed Code
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gesummv(int n, double alpha, double beta, double A[90][90], double B[90][90], double tmp[90], double x[90], double y[90])
{
    int i;
    int j;

#pragma scop

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}

#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}

    for (i = 0; i < 90; i++) {
        tmp[i] = 0.0;
        y[i] = 0.0;

        // Applying loop unrolling for the inner loop
        #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
        for (j = 0; j < 90; j++) {
            tmp[i] = A[i][j] * x[j] + tmp[i];
            y[i] = B[i][j] * x[j] + y[i];
        }
        y[i] = alpha * tmp[i] + beta * y[i];
    }

#pragma endscop
}
// ### Rationale Behind the Transformations
// 
// - **Loop Unrolling on the Inner Loop:** This is explicitly suggested by the original code through the use of `#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}`. Unrolling the inner loop can significantly increase the arithmetic intensity and reduce the overhead of loop control, making more efficient use of the FPGA resources by executing multiple operations in parallel.
// 
// - **Preserving Other Pragmas:** The original pragmas for pipelining, tiling, and parallelism hints are preserved. These directives suggest to the HLS tool that it should automatically manage these optimizations, which is often effective for FPGAs where the tooling can make architecture-specific decisions.
// 
// ### Conclusion
// The primary transformation applied here is reinforcing the loop unrolling directive for the inner loop, which is expected to enhance parallel execution capabilities. Other optimizations like tiling and pipelining are left to the HLS tool's discretion through the use of `auto` settings, assuming the tool has sufficient intelligence to optimize these based on the target architecture.
