// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access latency. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This is done to improve data locality and access patterns. For the second loop nest, permuting the loops will ensure that memory access is more sequential.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling**: This technique is used to break down the loops into smaller chunks that can fit into local memory (like cache), reducing the time spent on memory accesses.
// 
// 3. **Loop Distribution**: Not directly applicable here as we're not dealing with dependent loop nests that can be separated. However, the concept of separating concerns (computation vs. memory access) is kept in mind.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: Not applicable here as we don't have loops that can be combined without affecting the program's correctness.
// 
// Given these considerations, the primary transformation we'll apply is Loop Permutation for the second major loop to improve memory access patterns. Loop Tiling could also be considered, but without specific hardware details, it's challenging to choose an optimal tile size. We'll assume a generic optimization.
// 
// Here's the transformed code:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_mvt(double x1[400], double x2[400], double y_1[400], double y_2[400], double A[400][400]) {
  int i, j;

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (i = 0; i < 400; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction = x1 FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (j = 0; j < 400; j++) {
      x1[i] += A[i][j] * y_1[j];
    }
  }

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
  // Loop permutation applied here for better memory access pattern
  for (j = 0; j < 400; j++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction = x2 FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 400; i++) {
      x2[i] += A[j][i] * y_2[j];
    }
  }
}
// **Rationale Behind Transformations:**
// 
// - **Loop Permutation** in the second loop nest improves memory access patterns by accessing `A[j][i]` in a more sequential manner, which is beneficial for most memory hierarchies.
//   
// - **Loop Tiling** was considered but not explicitly applied due to lack of specific hardware details. It's a powerful optimization for improving cache utilization but requires knowledge of the cache size and structure to be most effective.
// 
// - **Loop Parallelization Pragmas** are kept as-is because they hint at the compiler to auto-optimize the parallelization factor, which is beneficial when targeting different hardware architectures without manual tuning.
// 
// These transformations aim to make the code more efficient for HLS by improving parallel execution capabilities and optimizing memory access patterns.
