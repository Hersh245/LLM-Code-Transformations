// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and resource utilization. Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_covariance(int m, int n, double float_n, double data[100][80], double cov[80][80], double mean[80]) {
  int i, j, k;

  // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and enable more effective parallelization.
  // TILE_SIZE should be chosen based on the target architecture's memory hierarchy and available resources.
  #define TILE_SIZE 10

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
    mean[j] = 0.0;

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=mean FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      mean[j] += data[i][j];
    }
    mean[j] /= float_n;
  }

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {

    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=data FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      data[i][j] -= mean[j];
    }
  }

  // Loop tiling for covariance computation
  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
  for (int ii = 0; ii < 80; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (int jj = ii; jj < 80; jj += TILE_SIZE) {

      #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
      for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 80; i++) {

        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L5}
        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 80; j++) {
          if (j >= i) { // Ensure we only compute the upper triangle (and diagonal)
            double temp_cov = 0.0;

            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=temp_cov FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
            for (k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
              temp_cov += data[k][i] * data[k][j];
            }
            temp_cov /= float_n - 1.0;
            cov[i][j] = temp_cov;
            cov[j][i] = temp_cov;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling for Covariance Calculation**: This transformation is applied to the covariance calculation loop to improve data locality. By processing the data in smaller blocks (tiles), we can make more efficient use of the cache, reducing memory access times. The choice of `TILE_SIZE` should be based on the specific architecture's cache size and organization to maximize cache hits.
// 
// 2. **Maintaining Pragmas**: All original pragmas are kept in place to ensure that the compiler's HLS directives for pipelining, tiling, and parallelism are respected. These directives hint at the compiler to optimize the loops for parallel execution, which is crucial for achieving high performance on FPGA or ASIC implementations.
// 
// 3. **Conditional Computation for Symmetric Matrix**: Since the covariance matrix is symmetric (`cov[i][j] = cov[j][i]`), we only need to compute the upper triangular part of the matrix and then mirror it. This reduces the number of computations by nearly half, improving performance and reducing resource utilization.
// 
// 4. **Loop Permutation, Distribution, or Fusion**: In this particular case, loop permutation or fusion was not applied as the original loop order seems optimal for memory access patterns (especially after applying tiling to the covariance computation). Loop distribution was implicitly applied through the process of tiling and separating the computation of the upper triangular matrix.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is optimized for HLS, potentially leading to better performance and more efficient resource utilization when synthesized for hardware accelerators like FPGAs.
