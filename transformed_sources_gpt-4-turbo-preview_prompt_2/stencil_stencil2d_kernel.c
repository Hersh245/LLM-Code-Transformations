// To optimize the given code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve data locality, parallelism, and pipeline efficiency. We'll focus on loop tiling and loop permutation as primary techniques for this transformation. Loop tiling will help in improving data locality and can potentially make better use of on-chip memory. Loop permutation can help in making the innermost loop have stride-1 accesses, which is more efficient for memory access patterns.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void stencil(int orig[8192], int sol[8192], int filter[9]) {
  int r, c, k1, k2, temp, mul;

  // Tile sizes for the loops
  const int RTileSize = 16; // Tile size for r loop
  const int CTileSize = 16; // Tile size for c loop

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

  // Tiled loops for r and c
  for (int rt = 0; rt < 128 - 2; rt += RTileSize) {
    for (int ct = 0; ct < 64 - 2; ct += CTileSize) {

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L1}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}

      // Original loops with adjusted bounds for tiling
      stencil_label1:
      for (r = rt; r < rt + RTileSize && r < 128 - 2; r++) {
        stencil_label2:
        for (c = ct; c < ct + CTileSize && c < 64 - 2; c++) {
          temp = ((int)0);

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
          stencil_label3:
          for (k1 = 0; k1 < 3; k1++) {
            stencil_label4:
            for (k2 = 0; k2 < 3; k2++) {
              mul = filter[k1 * 3 + k2] * orig[(r + k1) * 64 + c + k2];
              temp += mul;
            }
          }
          sol[r * 64 + c] = temp;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling for `r` and `c` Loops**: We introduced two outer loops, iterating over tiles of the original `r` and `c` loops. This transformation aims to improve data locality by working on smaller, contiguous blocks of data that fit into faster, on-chip memory. The tile sizes (`RTileSize` and `CTileSize`) are chosen as 16 as an example; the optimal size may vary depending on the target architecture and should be determined through experimentation.
// 
// 2. **Maintaining Original Loop Order inside Tiles**: We kept the original loop order (r, c, k1, k2) inside the tiles because it already ensures that the innermost loop accesses data with stride-1 (sequential memory access pattern), which is beneficial for memory access efficiency. Changing the loop order could disrupt this pattern.
// 
// 3. **Adjusting Bounds for Tiled Loops**: The bounds for the original `r` and `c` loops are adjusted to respect the tiling. We ensure that we don't exceed the original bounds of the loops (`128 - 2` for `r` and `64 - 2` for `c`) while processing tiles.
// 
// 4. **Preservation of Pragmas**: All original pragmas are preserved to maintain directives for pipeline, tile, and parallel optimizations. Adjustments to these pragmas or additional pragmas might be necessary after evaluating the performance of the transformed code and depending on the specifics of the target HLS tool and architecture.
// 
// This transformation aims to balance the benefits of data locality (through tiling) and efficient memory access patterns, without fundamentally altering the computation's correctness or introducing excessive complexity. Further optimizations might involve exploring different tile sizes, adding more aggressive loop unrolling, or experimenting with different memory partitioning strategies for the arrays involved.
