// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce memory access overhead. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_atax(double A[390][410], double x[410], double y[410], double tmp[390]) {
  int i, j;

  // Initialize y to 0. This loop is kept as is because it's already efficient.
  for (i = 0; i < 410; i++) {
    y[i] = ((double)0);
  }

  // Loop tiling is applied to improve data locality and cache usage.
  // However, given the nature of the computation, loop tiling might not directly apply to this algorithm without changing the memory access pattern significantly.
  // Instead, we focus on other optimizations like loop interchange and parallelization.

#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

  // Loop interchange is applied here to enhance memory access pattern and parallelism.
  // However, due to the dependencies in the original loops, direct loop interchange is not feasible without altering the algorithm's semantics.
  // Instead, we focus on maximizing the efficiency of the existing loop order through parallelism and reduction.

  for (i = 0; i < 390; i++) {
    tmp[i] = 0.0;

    // Apply parallelism to the inner loop to exploit data-level parallelism.
    // Reduction is used to ensure that updates to tmp[i] are handled correctly in a parallel context.
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=tmp FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (j = 0; j < 410; j++) {
      tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
    }

    // Similarly, apply parallelism to this loop to exploit data-level parallelism.
    // Reduction is used to ensure that updates to y[j] are handled correctly in a parallel context.
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=y FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (j = 0; j < 410; j++) {
      y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations
// 
// 1. **Loop Initialization of `y`:** This loop is kept as is because it's a straightforward initialization that doesn't benefit significantly from further optimization techniques like tiling or fusion.
// 
// 2. **Loop Tiling:** Although loop tiling is a common optimization to improve cache usage and reduce memory access times, the specific access patterns and dependencies in this code make it challenging to apply tiling directly without altering the algorithm's semantics. The primary goal of tiling—to bring data closer to computation in a cache-friendly manner—is less applicable here due to the linear and dependent nature of the computations.
// 
// 3. **Loop Interchange:** This technique is typically used to enhance locality of reference and improve cache performance. However, due to the dependencies between the computations of `tmp` and `y`, directly interchanging the loops could lead to incorrect results. The original loop order is preserved to maintain the algorithm's correctness.
// 
// 4. **Parallelism and Reduction:** The most significant optimizations come from applying parallelism to the inner loops, where independent computations allow for concurrent execution. The `reduction` clause is crucial for ensuring that updates to shared variables (`tmp` and `y`) are handled correctly, preserving the algorithm's semantics while exploiting parallel execution capabilities.
// 
// By focusing on parallelism and reduction, this optimized code aims to maximize the utilization of available hardware resources, improving the performance of the `kernel_atax` function in an HLS context.
