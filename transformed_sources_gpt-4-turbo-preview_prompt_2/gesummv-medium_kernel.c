// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply a few code transformations. The goal is to improve data locality, parallelism, and reduce the overall latency. Here's an optimized version of the code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_gesummv(double alpha, double beta, double A[250][250], double B[250][250], double tmp[250], double x[250], double y[250])
{
    int i, j;
    double temp_sum_A, temp_sum_B;

    // Loop tiling to improve cache locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory
    int TILE_SIZE = 50; // Example tile size, can be adjusted based on the target architecture's resources

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}

    for (i = 0; i < 250; i += TILE_SIZE) {
        int max_i = i + TILE_SIZE > 250 ? 250 : i + TILE_SIZE;

        for (j = 0; j < 250; j += TILE_SIZE) {
            int max_j = j + TILE_SIZE > 250 ? 250 : j + TILE_SIZE;

            // Loop distribution to enable parallel execution and reduce loop-carried dependencies
            #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
            for (int ti = i; ti < max_i; ti++) {
                temp_sum_A = 0.0;
                temp_sum_B = 0.0;
                for (int tj = j; tj < max_j; tj++) {
                    temp_sum_A += A[ti][tj] * x[tj];
                    temp_sum_B += B[ti][tj] * x[tj];
                }
                tmp[ti] += temp_sum_A;
                y[ti] += temp_sum_B;
            }
        }
    }

    // Final computation of y[i] after accumulating contributions from tiles
    for (i = 0; i < 250; i++) {
        y[i] = alpha * tmp[i] + beta * y[i];
    }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Each Transformation:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling (Blocking):** This transformation is applied to both the `i` and `j` loops. Loop tiling helps in improving the cache locality by processing the matrix in smaller blocks (tiles). This ensures that the data used by the computation (sub-matrices of `A` and `B`, and portions of `x`) stays in the cache longer, reducing memory access times.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution:** Inside the tiled loops, the computation is split into two parts: one for accumulating `temp_sum_A` and `temp_sum_B`, and another for updating `y[i]` based on `tmp[i]`. This separation allows for better parallelization opportunities, as the accumulation of `temp_sum_A` and `temp_sum_B` can be done independently for each tile. The final computation of `y[i]` is moved outside of the tiled loops to ensure correctness, as it depends on the complete accumulation in `tmp[i]`.
// 
// 3. **Parallelization Pragmas:** The original pragmas are retained to hint at the compiler for automatic parallelization, pipeline optimization, and tiling factors. These pragmas instruct the HLS tool to explore parallel execution of loop iterations and efficient pipelining of operations, further reducing the execution time.
// 
// 4. **Adjustment of Loop Bounds:** In the tiled loops, care is taken to handle cases where the matrix size is not a multiple of the tile size, ensuring correctness by adjusting the upper bounds of the loops.
// 
// By applying these transformations, the code is optimized for HLS by improving data locality, enabling parallelism, and making efficient use of on-chip memory resources, which can significantly reduce the execution time on FPGA or ASIC targets.
