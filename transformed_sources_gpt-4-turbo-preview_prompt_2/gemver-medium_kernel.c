// To optimize the given C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several transformations. The goal is to improve parallelism, data locality, and reduce the number of memory accesses. Here's how we can transform the code:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling**: This technique involves breaking down loops into smaller chunks or "tiles" to improve cache utilization and reduce memory access latency. We'll apply this to the main loops that iterate over the matrix `A`.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation**: This technique changes the nesting order of loops to improve data locality. For the loop that updates `x[i]`, permuting the loops can enhance performance by accessing continuous memory locations.
// 
// 3. **Loop Fusion**: This technique combines two separate loops that have the same loop bounds into a single loop to reduce loop overhead and improve data locality. However, in this specific code, loop fusion opportunities are limited due to the distinct operations performed in each loop.
// 
// 4. **Loop Distribution**: This technique splits a loop into multiple loops over the same range but with different bodies to allow for more parallelism or to separate reductions. However, given the structure of the code, loop distribution is already implicitly applied with the separation of concerns in each loop.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:

  int i, j, ii, jj;
  const int TILE_SIZE = 20; // Example tile size, can be adjusted for specific architectures

    for (jj = 0; jj < 400; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
      for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 400; i++) {

        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 400; j++) {
          A[i][j] += +u1[i] * v1[j] + u2[i] * v2[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }

  for (j = 0; j < 400; j++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=x FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L5}
    for (i = 0; i < 400; i++) {
      x[i] += beta * A[j][i] * y[j];
    }
  }

  // No change to this loop as it's already optimal for parallel execution
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
  for (i = 0; i < 400; i++) {
    x[i] = x[i] + z[i];
  }

  // Apply loop tiling to the loop that updates w[i]
#pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L3}
#pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L3}
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
  for (ii = 0; ii < 400; ii += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (jj = 0; jj < 400; jj += TILE_SIZE) {
      for (i = ii; i < ii + TILE_SIZE && i < 400; i++) {
#pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=w FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
        for (j = jj; j < jj + TILE_SIZE && j < 400; j++) {
          w[i] += alpha * A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// **Rationale Behind Transformations:**
// 
// - **Loop Tiling**: Applied to the loops iterating over `A` to enhance data locality and cache utilization. It's particularly effective for large matrices that don't fit entirely in cache.
// - **Loop Permutation**: Applied to the loop updating `x[i]` to ensure that memory accesses to `x` are sequential, improving memory access patterns and potentially cache performance.
// - **Loop Fusion and Distribution**: Not directly applied here due to the nature of operations within each loop. Each loop performs a distinct operation that doesn't lend itself easily to fusion without affecting the logic of the program.
// 
// These transformations aim to optimize the code for parallel execution and efficient memory access, which are critical for achieving high performance in HLS-targeted designs.
