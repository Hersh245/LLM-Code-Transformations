// To optimize the given C code snippet for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using code transformations such as loop permutation, loop tiling, loop distribution, or loop fusion, we'll focus on improving data locality, parallelism, and reducing the number of memory accesses. The original code already includes directives for pipelining and tiling, but we can further optimize it by applying loop transformations.
// 
// Here's the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_doitgen(double A[25][20][30], double C4[30][30], double sum[30])
{
  int r, q, p, s;

  // Loop tiling is applied to improve cache locality and enable more efficient use of on-chip memory.
  // The tile sizes are chosen based on typical cache line sizes and the architecture's specifics.
  // These values might need to be adjusted based on the actual hardware characteristics.
  int TILE_R = 5; // Tile size for the 'r' loop
  int TILE_Q = 10; // Tile size for the 'q' loop
  int TILE_P = 15; // Tile size for the 'p' loop

  // Loop permutation is applied to bring the innermost loop that has the reduction operation (sum_tmp)
  // to an outer position. This is done to facilitate better pipelining and parallel execution of the reduction.
  // However, due to data dependencies, we need to be careful with how we permute these loops.

  // Loop tiling
  for (int rr = 0; rr < 25; rr += TILE_R) {
    for (int qq = 0; qq < 20; qq += TILE_Q) {
      for (int pp = 0; pp < 30; pp += TILE_P) {

        // Original loop order resumed within each tile
        #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
        for (r = rr; r < min(25, rr + TILE_R); r++) {
          #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
          for (q = qq; q < min(20, qq + TILE_Q); q++) {
            #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto
            for (p = pp; p < min(30, pp + TILE_P); p++) {
              double sum_tmp = 0.0;
              #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL reduction=sum_tmp FACTOR=auto
              for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
                sum_tmp += A[r][q][s] * C4[s][p];
              }
              sum[p] = sum_tmp;
            }
            for (p = pp; p < min(30, pp + TILE_P); p++) {
              A[r][q][p] = sum[p];
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Transformations Applied:
// 
// 1. **Loop Tiling:** This transformation breaks the loops into smaller chunks or "tiles". This is particularly beneficial for improving data locality and making efficient use of the cache and on-chip memory. The tile sizes (`TILE_R`, `TILE_Q`, `TILE_P`) are chosen based on a heuristic or the specific architecture's cache line sizes and should be tuned for the target hardware.
// 
// 2. **Loop Permutation:** Although not directly applied in the transformed code due to data dependencies and the nature of the computation (reduction operation within the innermost loop), loop permutation is a powerful technique for optimizing memory access patterns and facilitating parallel execution. In this case, careful consideration of data dependencies limits the applicability of loop permutation without altering the program's semantics.
// 
// 3. **Pipelining and Parallelism Directives:** The original pragmas for pipelining and parallel execution are preserved and applied within the context of the tiled loops. These directives hint to the HLS tool to exploit parallelism and pipeline operations within loops, significantly improving execution speed on hardware.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion/Distribution:** Not directly applied in the transformed code, but it's worth noting that loop fusion (combining loops) or distribution (splitting loops) could be considered based on the specific computation and memory access patterns. In this case, the original structure of the loops and the operations within them (especially the reduction) dictate the transformations applied.
// 
// ### Note:
// The transformed code aims to balance between improving data locality through tiling and maintaining efficient parallel execution with pipelining and parallel directives. The specific tile sizes and the decision not to permute certain loops are based on the original code's structure and the nature of the computation. These decisions should be revisited and tuned based on the target hardware's characteristics and the results of empirical performance testing.
