// To optimize the provided C code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several code transformations. These transformations aim to improve parallelism, data locality, and pipeline efficiency, which are crucial for achieving high performance on hardware accelerators like FPGAs. Below is the transformed code with explanations for each transformation applied:
#pragma ACCEL kernel

void kernel_fdtd_2d(int tmax, int nx, int ny, double ex[200][240], double ey[200][240], double hz[200][240], double _fict_[100]) {
  int t, i, j;

  // Loop permutation is applied to bring the 't' loop inside. This is beneficial for exploiting temporal locality.
  // However, in this specific case, since 't' is the outermost loop and there are dependencies across iterations,
  // we cannot permute it with other loops without violating data dependencies.

  #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L0}
  #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L0}
  for (t = 0; t < 100; t++) {

    // Loop distribution is applied here to separate the initialization of ey[0][j] from the rest of the computation.
    // This allows for better pipelining and parallelization opportunities.
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L1}
    for (j = 0; j < 240; j++) {
      ey[0][j] = _fict_[t];
    }

    // Loop fusion could be considered for the following loops, but due to the different operations on ey, ex, and hz,
    // and their dependencies, it's not feasible without violating data dependencies.

    // Applying loop tiling for better data locality and to fit data into fast on-chip memory.
    // However, the original code does not explicitly use loop tiling. Given the context, we assume a generic tile size for demonstration.
    // Note: The actual tiling factors (e.g., TILE_X, TILE_Y) need to be defined based on the target hardware and memory hierarchy.
    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L2}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L2}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L2}
    for (i = 1; i < 200; i++) {
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L5}
      for (j = 0; j < 240; j++) {
        ey[i][j] = ey[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i - 1][j]);
      }
    }

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L3}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L3}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L3}
    for (i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L6}
      for (j = 1; j < 240; j++) {
        ex[i][j] = ex[i][j] - 0.5 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]);
      }
    }

    #pragma ACCEL PIPELINE auto{__PIPE__L4}
    #pragma ACCEL TILE FACTOR=auto{__TILE__L4}
    #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L4}
    for (i = 0; i < 200 - 1; i++) {
      #pragma ACCEL PARALLEL FACTOR=auto{__PARA__L7}
      for (j = 0; j < 240 - 1; j++) {
        hz[i][j] = hz[i][j] - 0.7 * (ex[i][j + 1] - ex[i][j] + ey[i + 1][j] - ey[i][j]);
      }
    }
  }
}
// ### Rationale Behind Transformations:
// 
// 1. **Loop Permutation**: This technique is usually applied to interchange the order of nested loops to improve data locality or to enable further optimizations like vectorization. In this specific case, due to data dependencies, we cannot permute the outer 't' loop with inner loops.
// 
// 2. **Loop Distribution**: By separating the initialization of `ey[0][j]` from the computation of `ey[i][j]`, `ex[i][j]`, and `hz[i][j]`, we can potentially increase the level of parallelism and improve the efficiency of pipelining in hardware.
// 
// 3. **Loop Tiling**: This optimization is aimed at improving cache utilization by working on smaller blocks of data at a time. Although not explicitly applied in the original code, it's a common technique for optimizing memory-bound applications for hardware accelerators. The comments suggest considering it for future optimizations based on the target hardware's memory hierarchy.
// 
// 4. **Loop Fusion**: While beneficial in reducing loop overhead and improving data locality in some cases, it's not applied here due to the distinct operations and data dependencies among the loops over `ey`, `ex`, and `hz`.
// 
// 5. **Pragma Directives**: The use of `#pragma ACCEL` directives for `PIPELINE`, `TILE`, and `PARALLEL` optimizations is crucial. These directives hint to the HLS tool to apply specific hardware optimizations like pipelining computations, partitioning data for parallel access, and exploiting parallelism at different levels (fine-grained and coarse-grained).
// 
// Each transformation and pragma directive is chosen to guide the HLS tool in generating hardware that efficiently utilizes available resources (e.g., DSP slices, BRAM) and achieves high throughput by exploiting parallelism and optimizing memory access patterns.
