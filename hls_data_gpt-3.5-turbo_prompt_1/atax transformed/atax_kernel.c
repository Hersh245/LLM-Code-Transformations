// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The loops have been permuted so that the inner loop now iterates over the columns of the matrix A and vector x, which can improve data locality and cache performance.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The loops have been tiled to split the computation into smaller tiles, which can help improve memory access patterns and reduce data dependencies.
// 3. Loop Distribution: The computation has been distributed across the outer loop to parallelize the calculation of tmp and y values, which can lead to better utilization of resources in HLS.
// 4. Loop Fusion: The loops for calculating tmp and y values have been fused together to reduce loop overhead and improve parallelism.
