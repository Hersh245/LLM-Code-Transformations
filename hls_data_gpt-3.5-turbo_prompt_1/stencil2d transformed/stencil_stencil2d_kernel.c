// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: Reordered the nested loops to have the innermost loop iterate over the columns (c) instead of rows (r). This can improve data locality and cache efficiency as the inner loop accesses elements in a contiguous manner.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The code already has loop tiling directives, so no changes were made in this transformation. Tiling can help optimize memory access patterns and improve parallelism by breaking down the computation into smaller tiles.
// 3. Loop Distribution: No loop distribution was performed as the code structure did not lend itself to this transformation. Loop distribution can help balance workload across different processing units.
// 4. Loop Fusion: No loop fusion was performed as the code structure did not have adjacent loops that could be fused together. Loop fusion can reduce loop overhead and improve data reuse.
