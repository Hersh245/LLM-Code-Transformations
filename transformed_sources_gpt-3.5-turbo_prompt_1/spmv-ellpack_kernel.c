// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The loops have been permuted to have the outer loop iterate over `j` and the inner loop iterate over `i`. This can help improve data locality and cache utilization as the inner loop accesses contiguous memory locations.
// 2. Loop Tiling: The loops have been tiled to process data in smaller chunks. This can help improve memory access patterns and exploit parallelism more efficiently.
// 3. Loop Distribution: The loops have not been distributed as the code already has a good balance of computation and memory access within each loop iteration.
// 4. Loop Fusion: The loops have not been fused as they are already performing distinct computations and fusing them may not provide any significant optimization.
