// Explanation:
// 1. Loop Permutation: The outer loop has been changed to iterate over `j` instead of `i`. This change can improve data locality and cache efficiency by accessing elements of array `B` in a more contiguous manner.
// 2. Loop Tiling: Tiling has been applied to both loops to partition the computation into smaller tiles that can fit into cache memory. This can help reduce memory access latency and improve data reuse.
// 3. Loop Distribution: The loops have been distributed to optimize parallelism and pipeline efficiency. By distributing the loops in this way, the code can take advantage of parallel processing units more effectively.
// 4. Loop Fusion: The loops have not been fused in this transformation as it may not provide significant benefits in this case. The existing loop structure seems to be well-optimized for HLS.
