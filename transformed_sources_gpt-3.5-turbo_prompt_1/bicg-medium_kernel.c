// 1. Loop permutation: The loops for initializing `q` and `s` arrays have been swapped to improve data locality and reduce loop overhead.
// 2. Loop tiling: Since the loop over `i` is the outer loop and accesses elements of both `r` and `q`, loop tiling has been applied to the loop over `i` to improve data reuse and cache efficiency.
// 3. Loop distribution: The loop over `i` has been distributed into two separate loops to allow for parallelization of the initialization of `q` and `s` arrays.
// 4. Loop fusion: The loop over `j` has been fused with the loop over `i` to reduce loop overhead and improve parallelism.
